yes , good day ladies , my gentlemen .
thank you very much to talk about here today .
and i 've got to imagine myself .
my name is christian <unk> and i 'm <unk> , <unk> at the city .
that 's what 's called <unk> for eight years .
and my favorite is : first , one , the organization , third , the public policy .
so i 'm responsible for the <unk> of this city .
and you do n't do so popular .
i know .
and beyond that , and that 's a little bit of my son , i 'm also <unk> .
this is what i call the head of <unk> fire .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and of course , i think , is a topic that i want to talk to you today .
because with the topic of <unk> , because that 's what it is .
we hope to be the best and prepare to the worst , which is jack in the moment that jack .
you know him .
he was at general <unk> .
and then i 'm going to start something very serious .
i 'm going to give you a way .
so , we 're going to talk , if there is a risk that we 're going to be in short , for example , <unk> <unk> , rush hour .
many people are on the road .
it 's pushing , it 's <unk> .
and somewhere at the edge is a suitcase , lonely , slightly <unk> , maybe signs of signs .
none of them seems to belong .
the suitcase is not yours .
suddenly , a <unk> .
leave the <unk> .
police come , fire .
people call people .
elected officials .
go out .
what 's going on ?
we do n't know that , or we ca n't say it .
the people leave the building .
children crying .
some people may even fall , because it needs to go quickly .
all of a matter of things .
there 's <unk> inside .
a panic is <unk> .
i 'm going to hear here .
the rest is my imagination .
but it 's not a fantasy that i 'm going to do .
this is what happened in this week in <unk> .
there 's been a suitcase .
afterwards , it turned out that only , in <unk> , nine pounds of drugs were drugs .
but people were just like this , and so , a friend of me came out of the building .
there was nothing .
and it came exactly this piece of things , all of the group , my friend in my friend 's my friend .
you know , god is not panic , otherwise , the whole lot of things would n't be hostile , <unk> like it seems .
you see , in a <unk> , in a <unk> disaster , communication is a whole important thing .
communication is important because the people in this situation is <unk> to communication .
you want to know what 's going on .
in the good old old time , it was still easy to the authorities .
we just have nothing said or we lied .
why ?
it 's because of the so-called hemisphere .
you have to be <unk> with that , god that would get people in the panic , and we do n't rather say the truth or the truth .
this is in a time of social media , in a time of twitter , in a time of facebook , in a time of private and public health , in a period of <unk> and public rights and public rights .
so simple , because one is not morally , and the second is mostly anyway , we 're anyway .
you may remember the <unk> in the hudson river , some year ago .
the first one came on about twitter .
so , from somebody who was on a ferry on a ferry and <unk> , this is a plane , and we 're going to save people now .
this was not a <unk> .
you see , we 're dependent on , we 're just using the truth , and <unk> <unk> the truth and to inform very <unk> .
because mostly , of course , we 're also the last ones that we have to know the truth because of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , that we 're going to pay attention to all information .
and this is public media or private media , or the private media either not held so much , or they do n't just do it .
so , from that , we 're going to be in food , and that 's also something that went through the media , we 're thinking about how we deal with <unk> .
and we 're going to make the good old <unk> again .
but it 's just as a form of <unk> .
this is what we 're going to do about a hundred years of <unk> in the <unk> , which is , some of you know , some of you know , <unk> , if it 's going to be a <unk> .
it was in the old days .
you may probably know , you know , what three times is short , short , once short .
i do n't know .
we 're going to talk about this today , with all the <unk> that we have in this position , <unk> , about facebook , over twitter , about television , about television and the local media and so on , and so forth , of course ,
and we know , we need to move very quickly and <unk> , and we have to inform it very quickly and <unk> , because the <unk> and citizens are going to be licensed .
and we also have no longer believe what we want to say .
so communication in the crisis , in the crisis , in the crisis , is a question of all of all of all the media that are available to us , and it 's also a question of credibility .
and it 's our biggest problem , our biggest problem , because the <unk> and citizens either say , they 're just doing it again , it 's not true , or you 're saying , it 's all worse than it 's actually worse than it is in reality .
we 've also done good experience with facebook and twitter , recently .
you may have a few of you in the media .
we had had a larger <unk> of food in food .
and this is a <unk> bomb .
these are bombs that are bombs that are filled with a <unk> , because they 're not going to explode the first <unk> on the <unk> , but by the houses in the world war ii and only on the ground in the second world war , and just because of a chemical <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> two <unk> of each other to each other .
the problem is only , many of these bombs have never works , and they 're like <unk> in the <unk> of anything else in food .
and then , there 's a bit of my son , his conscience , he was so beautiful in the protocol , he wanted to make a little bit , he was now , he 'd been seen as you 'd like , and now <unk> the authorities that is a bomb .
by the way , several older gentlemen have been born in the <unk> .
we 're going to see what we 're going to find all .
these bombs need to be <unk> , not <unk> , but <unk> .
and so we just have a <unk> park , and it 's literally , literally , in any sense of the word , a bomb <unk> .
and in the history , in the history of the city , the whole communication of facebook , and twitter , let 's have a look at the consequence that all of the <unk> , that all of the <unk> are followed by <unk> <unk> , which is followed .
and the media was excited .
we did n't even have to once with the phone , but they had to have <unk> and <unk> , everything about <unk> and twitter .
and the whole thing had a great effect for us , because the credibility is going to increase our social media .
i mean , you have to give me a sign that i want to stop .
i ca n't look at the watch here .
so this is the credibility , because all of the social media have the advantage that you have to tell you that you are very information .
not so much <unk> is because the members of tweeting you tweeting or the <unk> , how you call it a high school problem .
the second , fast background .
now , if something is not true , somebody 's someone immediately , so that the credibility that i 've just been talking about , it 's actually going to be the whole community in the <unk> .
and it 's a very high <unk> , so if anything 's wrong , it can be very quickly .
and we have a huge <unk> .
and i said that i 'd like to find a <unk> that was going up in the <unk> park .
so from that , we 've been coming from all the things that are happening in the last years , and it 's much more <unk> than <unk> , as a result of one , as a <unk> .
the city can take home every day of such a day .
a bomb that needs to be a bomb in a park , certainly not one .
but it can also be found , and again , we 're going to be found in the <unk> , and then we 're standing there with our <unk> , and we try to <unk> that in seven feet .
and if you think about <unk> , you think of other cities , if you 're going to get off the other cities , if you have to scale off , because they 're actually a so-called <unk> that you can not attract conventional , you know , you know , a number of houses
and to communicate that is important because it 's just necessary to be able to deal in one world , to prevent communications , to prevent communication , to prevent people to worry that people are informed to worry about that the people are able to be able to persuade that difficult situation .
and the social media also help us have to be <unk> , because they 're all involved in communication , and it 's not just a <unk> <unk> of communication , and it 's not just the <unk> .
so , today , not only is not just an issue of the authorities , not just a problem of fire or the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , red cross goes on , but communication is going to be
and <unk> showed that .
there 's a lot of twitter and over facebook , in fact , a lot of the help , if you were a lot of the help , if you were , you know , if you were , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , a lot of people were going to build a little bit of people , and you did n't know how to do anything else
so this is still a lot of doing a lot of doing a lot of , too , for public communication in the <unk> , but the unprecedented solidarity with the <unk> and the <unk> has just showed that the social media from a <unk> from a communication from a communication
and i hope that i 'm going to persuade you a little bit of this medium , which is actually used for the beautiful things of life , including his sense , including his sense , and the city that 's going to be done as a city that is in the future of <unk> , and that 's going to be completely completely <unk> , to the citizens of the <unk> and the citizens , and
thank you .
so , a beautiful evening .
i 'm a <unk> .
i 'm a writer and <unk> , like you 've just heard .
and i 'm now looking at a way of doing a own <unk> problem .
what it is , i 'm going to produce <unk> , i 'm going to do that .
before i do that , i need to do some things .
the first is , i think we really need stories to life .
that we could not live without stories .
i also believe that there 's a lot more <unk> , <unk> , <unk> stories are actually being produced by the entertainment industry .
and i still believe that the internet , which is not quite much as good as anybody <unk> is <unk> properly .
and fourth , i 'm convinced that people have been created to be creative .
and that they are happier , as soon as they can be creative .
the more people are happy , the better it is about the world .
most logical .
now this better world is just a byproduct .
i was , in the first line , i said , a storyteller .
and the story that i want to tell is to start with midnight in a <unk> , in the moment of being happy <unk> .
this is <unk> .
and it 's <unk> birthday .
now , you get now with the <unk> and not just so much with the sing , because at the moment that it 's getting midnight , in midnight , is something with you .
it 's happening something in your head , in your body , with your perception .
and she does n't really have the words .
you do n't know what happens .
i mean , i have words .
i call this the wizard of <unk> .
you see the one side of <unk> and <unk> in <unk> , and everything is pretty black .
i feel like i 'm sort of <unk> .
<unk> .
and on the other hand , we have the two and the other hand in the country with all the color .
and , in this point , i said , i said , i said , i was better <unk> and writing when i record .
so , the first thing that <unk> now now with her new perception is a total man with <unk> <unk> hair that says she is very serious , and says , congratulations , your life is over .
this is <unk> .
and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that you heard about a very special kind of people .
she was born as a <unk> .
you have to have people who have to have to have to have to have to get on their <unk> to play your lifetime .
who of you know ?
very beautiful .
imagine if you 're going to pick up the <unk> of it , if you hit your collide , but <unk> from the bag .
so cube , <unk> , <unk> , all sorts of things .
what really important is the players have no insight on their own .
we do n't know when we die .
i want to be a long life , but we simply do n't know .
it 's all over the morning .
and it 's like my players .
you do n't know how much it can actually play .
and that means , every time , every time , that was the last one .
one player that has <unk> his entire lifetime , <unk> in the moment of <unk> like a candle that will be <unk> .
now , of course , you can ask yourself , if that 's a dangerous thing , why do you play it ?
the answer is clearly that .
without play , without play , no players around you , <unk> , <unk> and only if one player is actually alive .
they were born .
so .
this story of <unk> and how you talk about the world of the player , and that 's what 's going to be in love with love , and of course , that 's the story that i want to tell .
and it 's in a form of a <unk> .
the first season , i 'm sorry , i 'm sorry , is one of the <unk> that i 've just seen late .
so 12 consequences in the first season with a distance from five to seven minutes .
this kind of <unk> , a consequence of the other , beautiful <unk> tells you that you know .
television has nothing else since his <unk> .
this is not new .
and if it would be all , i 'd done one .
and also , at all .
now it 's just right .
so let 's go back to <unk> .
what 's the most famous sentence out of the film or from the series ?
it can only give you one , right .
thank you .
as if we had practiced .
and that 's not the case that my player does not .
there can be a lot of people .
there are so many different games .
think about <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and so forth .
and that 's exactly what the number is also the number of players .
and therefore , there are a lot of stories that are all being told .
now the next question , who is to tell that because of all ?
i 've got a very high view of me .
i think i 'm going to be smart smart and extraordinarily creative .
but i know that a hundred brain more brains produce more than only one , even when it 's mine .
and so directly to the idea that you see the crowd with the creative process .
what if we were not simply simply just <unk> or allow them to be <unk> , but even <unk> ?
so if you say , we 're going to say , we 're going to try and make you try to get you very much a lot of care of this piece of evolution .
so imagine , for example , in the episode of three , a piece of <unk> that they 're totally excited about , because he reminds you for example of her grandfather .
they 're also a giant fan of <unk> .
now , you can just now , now , with the technology , is not so hard to do a <unk> .
and this shop on the <unk> , where it goes directly , and this is the really cool stuff that will really be interested in .
that means that it 's not going under , but it goes directly to where it 's supposed to land .
the really beautiful is that we are in the internet .
and in the internet , you can really do anything .
so each medium is somehow allowed .
that means that it means you can write , draw , draw , whatever you want to do .
and we 're now looking at this structure now .
this little bit of <unk> from <unk> web , right ?
this is what this <unk> thing is built together .
and i really am convinced that the internet was born , to tell that kind of stories .
it 's not just not so many , unless you do n't even do anything .
so , now , i 'm going to take a step further and let the audience will be going to players .
it 's in a <unk> .
but you can not go on the characters of the characters , but also against people against people in the real environment , which is also these <unk> patterns on your cell phone .
<unk> that you know , they 're all very very very very good , are such as mobile <unk> and <unk> entertainment .
these wonderful areas that are looking very rapidly .
and that i ca n't go , because i would need back 20 minutes .
we even put together together .
each one is three parts .
the first part is the second part , the second piece is the shaper , and then we have the <unk> .
and with this <unk> , i could be the jury of the moment , right now , i have to be able to see the short thing : the <unk> innovation .
and they have given me the first price for the best <unk> .
and i need to say , this jury was from <unk> of banks , from the <unk> , <unk> and so on .
so a reasonable people , should you be my .
and if i can convince you , here with my mind , the internet is right , <unk> structures , and i think i can really convince everyone .
so .
so every one is , why is this all the way ?
because in this name , all the areas are covered .
so , of course , we have first of the <unk> : who is , i 'm it , you 're it , everybody 's it .
of course , the dying thing .
in the series , it 's going to have died .
every one of them is , everybody needs to die .
and then , of course , every one of them is in the sense of everybody , if he wants to .
that 's really important .
i come out of the <unk> , and there 's nothing worse than when it 's going to be a <unk> .
i do n't know if you know that .
and if you 're in the theater , the actors comes in the auditorium and all the god , i 'm not saying , please .
and that 's not .
so it 's <unk> interaction .
and nobody needs to .
it can be just the audience .
the reason why i 'm talking about german is that the whole project will be in german , first .
it also has some reasons .
and i 've been asking with this project , i 've been asking for this project , and i 'd been asking again , and i 'm going to ask you to do this , i 'm going to go on english , demographic blah .
i can just say , the german <unk> is the third of the world .
the <unk> is the english `` spanish '' and then the german .
so it 's not as if we 're going to move ourselves in any small trip .
and i really really believe really , if it comes to other people like me that the people will be grateful for something that has n't been <unk> by any <unk> , where everybody has been <unk> .
and if it 's all like that , i 'd like to have this , the first outcome now go online .
and if you ask yourself , why i 'm now in a <unk> , where it 's going to go under the headline <unk> <unk> .
i 've done some thoughts .
i love <unk> .
not just <unk> .
i 'm also dependent on <unk> and <unk> .
some <unk> were also <unk> .
and i can just say that this entire knowledge is incredibly important and incredible .
but it does n't use anything if you do n't apply it .
and my project is just <unk> thing , where i just took everything that i 've been doing .
and it 's been applied .
and so far it 's doing fine .
i can just say i 'm going to say .
so , if somebody think , i want to contribute to my part , i had a idea of a idea of character , or i have a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
you 're going to find us on the internet .
on facebook .
great , like <unk> .
yeah , i also do .
so welcome to : can you delete memories ?
here 's a question .
can you delete memory ?
can you remember anything about what 's going on in your life ?
have you still forgotten ?
who can remember who still remember ?
it 's not going to go up your hands .
so , can you delete memory ?
apparently .
thank you very much .
no , we do n't want to do it today .
i mean , it would be a very short thing .
so again , my name is samuel <unk> .
and the talk today , i decided , because he 's got two of my passions or my two big qualities right now .
i 've been talking about <unk> , and i 'm wearing with the bits and bytes of bytes , which is how big through the world .
and in fact , some time , i 'm now as coach and <unk> in the private and professional park .
so , on the one hand , i 've got a lot of with the computer , on the other side of the other side , i 'm right now in the human <unk> , so how does this work the human human ?
how do you change that ?
that 's about a comparison with a comparison .
i was a very interesting discussion of talking about artificial intelligence , <unk> <unk> .
so the question was , when can we build a computer that works as works as the human brain ?
so , and i think that 's where we are quite close to it .
so i think it 's about two , three hundred years , no longer needs it .
but let me do a little bit about why that may be a little bit more little .
so this is comparison between the computer , and our brain on the other side is on the other side .
if we take the computer , so , all , your smartphone , your tablet , your tablet , and these cameras , and all all smart refrigerators somewhere on <unk> little chip .
he 's called cpu , central <unk> .
these pieces are put together together from <unk> transistors .
the word is determines everybody , and it 's going to be a triangle .
and the <unk> little device , that has three <unk> , and it does n't matter how to do it .
in our laboratory , in our condition , we have <unk> <unk> , about five hundred million of these little units .
and then the shut down there .
we store things , we calculate things , we had a degrees of albert einstein 's albert einstein , yeah , <unk> computer can can be very much , very quickly , but actually compare it and a little bit .
it 's not .
it 's actually pretty stupid .
so let 's compare it with our brain .
our brain has a smallest unit of the neuron , the universe , and we have this , too , i have <unk> , so i 've got <unk> , so , a hundred billion , so a hundred billion neurons are in our gray mass .
but the beautiful thing is , our neurons have not just three connections , but they have <unk> to <unk> per neuron .
and that makes a <unk> <unk> , just because it 's beautiful , is 10 trillion .
these are 10 , 14 zeros .
so , you know , you see the complexity of our brain is about some more than what we have now as a computer .
if we want to compare to the <unk> , maybe one or other know , the first supercomputers , they had their own power door , ha the <unk> , and with the <unk> ' campus .
now , our <unk> <unk> sometimes sometimes , but the box up here is about 20 watts .
and that 's the equivalent of that , and that 's the equivalent of two big bananas , so you do n't need you and you put your computer up there .
now , if we 're now <unk> <unk> great , <unk> <unk> calculators with <unk> , why we do n't do that , why do we forget things ?
maybe one or other know that one or other ones will be these <unk> on the internet , so that the human human brain uses only 10 percent of his brain , you 're going to buy this <unk> to the <unk> brain .
and then you know , there 's a little bit of <unk> .
ten percent yes , but our brain is yes in the course of our evolution to this mass of evolution , which is <unk> little , <unk> in the middle , all of the <unk> in the middle .
it 's certainly not happened because we do n't use that .
so why does it seem to leave the biggest part of it ?
now , maybe you know the term of <unk> ?
so , i 'm looking at the way that i see the iceberg , when you see the iceberg , you see the iceberg , in the oceans , there 's the top , the surface is coming down .
and that 10 percent of the top , that 's about what our <unk> , our <unk> mind is , but <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
we <unk> the statement of how we <unk> <unk> , we <unk> <unk> , slow slow but we <unk> creative creative .
and , in order to get back into this memory , maybe one or other people with <unk> memory .
people , who suddenly can remember a lot more detail than i do n't see in the situation of <unk> , and then the tell you , i said , `` well , how do you know that ?
you know , there 's a special , one of the <unk> , so somebody with <unk> , somebody else 's <unk> , who is a <unk> memory that will have a <unk> memory , <unk> , in a helicopter , so rome is
and it 's not kind of like this , and there is that , no , every single house , every single door , every single windows , every single windows he saw , he 's <unk> , he could take paper .
so how do you get this ?
so why can the why do n't we ca n't , well , that may be a very close , which is a little bit more likely to access to its <unk> percent .
now we 're going to use that , but why do n't i remember the <unk> night , in all the detail ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> has made interesting experiences to be interesting experiences .
he used to be working for example , for example , has been working with an escape that had been completely eliminated , that was not more your mind , that 's not more your mind , that 's not a way .
wonderful , so that 's very good .
now it 's about making people <unk> .
and there 's a very safe session that you can see in the end of the end , or after this event , even if you could not remember the end of it , then you could recognize the word of the car that these people were leaving
and in fact , with this hallmark of one of the perpetrator .
the second thing i thought was really great , he has a lady in <unk> , who tells her mother to tell you that their mother has to read them in wonderland when she was small , so four years .
and she was sitting on the lap of her mother and her mother .
and then he said , in <unk> , read it .
and then they started reading , she was four than this is , she could n't read , you can not read .
and then she said , he said , tell me the <unk> .
in fact , they actually found a copy of alice in wonderland , where right on this side of text , which is read about the lady .
so the brain has this page as it was like <unk> .
you could read it .
so yes , we actually have access to it , but we seem to be in the normal life we have <unk> kind of <unk> <unk> to do it .
now , we 're not looking at the event , but as <unk> said , he has seen a picture , a <unk> , so we can see what we see , what we hear , hey , what we 're looking at , hey , what we 're looking at , hey , what we 're looking at and feel
and , you know , it was <unk> long , you 're going to be able to take a <unk> , ha <unk> , i can ask you , but just short your eyes .
and remember a very , positive event in the youngest past , yes .
take the first one .
and if you 're going to do that now , you may be familiar to you that you can get a visual piece .
you may get a picture , maybe even a movie ?
well , some of them do n't matter , because we 're doing that as normal , but they do that for the first time .
and if you see this , it can be , you 're either going to see everything , from your eyes of all the eyes , or as you see yourself on a canvas .
this one is what we call <unk> , the other <unk> .
thank you very much , you 're allowed to solve again , the eyes can open back .
who 's got a visual information ?
yes , so there 's a couple of hands , which is so , <unk> third , i would say , yes , that is about what i expected , it 's actually something that we do , it 's actually something that we 're doing so often , that it 's not realizing that it 's not realizing .
well , do n't leave .
and what 's beautiful about memory is , if you do memory memory , it 's not just the memory , <unk> <unk> feels like that , and i 'm going to see that one of a positive event , and i 've been looking at the other way , and i may be laughing , and in fact ,
and now what 's exciting .
<unk> everything was before , well , that 's what our brain does , is not a difference between what we actually reminds , and what we just think of what we 're doing .
you can do that , if you sit down , you sit up at home , and you can imagine something in the future that 's not going to happen , you 're going to take a similar information like something , if you remember something that was in the past .
and , you know , you know , you know , you know these stories that you 're talking about , in <unk> , of course .
so , you know , hey , there 's happening , and it 's so beautiful , and that was so beautiful , and the longer these stories are <unk> , the more beautiful , hey , there was a lot of <unk> , there was a lot of
so if we do this , so , if we actually do our memory so much our memory , why do n't we do that because i do n't active , do i think ?
<unk> when i came here , my uncle has showed me a picture of his hut in switzerland .
a very beautiful picture , it 's also a very beautiful hut .
just , the picture of <unk> is a little bit more beautiful than the shack , so it 's artistic freedom , he 's just <unk> me , so there 's a <unk> <unk> , there 's a gorgeous dog in front of the alps , which is a picture of this shack ,
and why do n't we do that because of our own thought , our own memory , hey , what bothers me to do , when i do another beautiful , what i think about it ?
they actually have artistic freedom in their own thoughts .
you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you see that you see the morning you see in the morning , if you just have gray eyes , what 's going on ?
i 've slept , i was sick , i went to my head out of the head .
it 's really the night , and this idea did n't leave me anymore .
i think it 's the other way that he did n't go .
son , <unk> friend of me had a little depressed when he came to germany , because his mother was in <unk> , and he just got it just awful .
so what the father did , so he goes down every night and she said , or she said , `` well , asked me , what was the most beautiful thing that 's happened today ?
now , what was the most beautiful , tell him , and then he got him to tell him , got him to be able to leave him , he 's got to tell him what 's happened today .
and , within two weeks , the son was doing fine .
and then it was all right away that is coming back again .
and that 's where the whole adolescence has been done with that , which is one of the most low-tech people i know .
so it 's not the memories that affect us in the way we are , but it 's our focus to our focus on what we 're doing .
and how much energy we can spend around or use .
so if you talk about <unk> <unk> , or say , this is ow , this is now ow , this is so <unk> , this is so <unk> , i 'm not going to do this , you know , you know , it 's just about tom cruise in this <unk> <unk> , which is you know , <unk> , you know , you know , you know ,
what 's `` <unk> '' we <unk> , ah , yes , <unk> there , <unk> , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , that was really a great story ? ''
and then they take this one .
take this with your <unk> , and let 's go .
or if you failed to rob somebody 's bitter , <unk> , it 's <unk> your boss , or your wife , or your husband , they laugh .
so , let 's take the picture , put it out , <unk> <unk> hat .
<unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> , let 's jump in the background , jump down , you laugh ?
because they 're <unk> , because they 're fun .
and you can get much better with the situation .
so can i do memory memories ?
no , i think our brain can have so much capacity that it can store everything .
but it does n't matter because we can pay free how much we focus and how important we have a event , a memory that is based on us .
my plea to you , you play with you , play with the images in your head , take your <unk> , and give them every day that your lives .
yes good afternoon .
thank you very much .
when i 'm going to talk to a party , what i 'm doing in my time and i 'm going to tell you , with friends , i 'm going to go together with friends and go , i see bright eyes , and in the head of my listener , the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
and then , if i 'm going to suggest that it 's a call for classical music , then this <unk> <unk> images of <unk> of old people who are sitting in <unk> and very concentrated of art .
and frank <unk> said to talk about music is like to dance like architecture .
that 's the same way that we can do with what we do .
and so i 'm going to talk to a little bit of what i talk about , i brought you a short film .

it 's a sort of <unk> <unk> it .
that brings it out of my view of my view on the point .
since <unk> is growing out of the <unk> , really , to make something completely different .
we 're <unk> in the middle of <unk> and middle , end of 20 old , and have been very early in our adolescence and the incredible force and joy is classical music .
we also have seen that the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> that we have some joy , well , you can do a little <unk> .
and we 're not recognizing that the so-called crisis of the classical music is not in the content , so with the music itself , but in its <unk> .
so , let 's ask the question how we can create a <unk> that music , the friends and the force again , that we like so much .
how can we organize a <unk> that works beyond the <unk> of the <unk> ?
we see the parameters that you know from the classical concert , space , time , light , context , is basically in question .
take the relationship between the audience and musicians .
usually between the stage and the audience 's audience .
we 're trying to do the <unk> .
here you see a picture of our <unk> .
the musician are sitting in the audience , drink of beer , talk about the audience with the audience , standing in , play , two pieces , are in audience .
this is a little bit of <unk> in the evening .
everybody who feels <unk> , comes on the stage and goes back .
or the sit in the concert .
so , in the classical concert , it 's so that you 're on more or less comfortable , <unk> chairs , so much as you 're here , and listening to front .
but there 's music that you can actually sit there .
and we 've done that , how can we do that .
when you sit in different and you can be able to <unk> a <unk> piece of music , you 're going to be automatically different .
that is that we did n't have a stage at this concert , but four stages to the audience .
the audience could be <unk> .
so on the evening , everybody once in the first row .
it 's important to us that we do n't just make any kind of <unk> , but we think about the music .
so that we ask ourselves to wonder what the spaces and <unk> all of it , but is the way that music needs to work that way , that it can work like it ?
and then , there 's a clock in the morning of <unk> at the age of <unk> , the s actually will actually be <unk> by <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> .
but not just the spaces of the way , and the lighting can get music to be alive and now , but also the connection with other .
and so we 're totally happy that we have been working with a couple of years with a couple of years , with a couple of years , working together with the <unk> , that 's going to be <unk> with us or movement to music that actually did n't have been written for the dancing .
and this is what 's going to be <unk> for <unk> , or for <unk> , from steve reich .
and in this year , we have one , yes , if you want to fill it up .
we 've got a concert in the first time we have a concert with a <unk> record .
we have the story of the soldiers of <unk> with <unk> , dancers , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
that 's why has been working because we had a big <unk> that support us in this piece .
we have <unk> a lot of a lot of money from people out of human beings from the germany , so we could put it up .
at all , this vocabulary is something that comes out from a community .
and we 're totally happy to find a home near <unk> in the town of <unk> .
because the city is exactly the big that we find great spaces and exciting places for concerts , but also as small , that we are familiar .
in the spring of the year , in the spring of the spring , in the spring of the spring , <unk> from the spring of europe , from europe , from europe , in the city , it 's simply in the city of <unk> in the city , that in the city , more than usually .
the whole term is called <unk> .
we 're <unk> in a <unk> mix of students and students , students , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , really completely <unk> .
and to be a <unk> <unk> that 's going to keep the <unk> and coordination and funding in the eye , seven to 10 makers in a <unk> that spend <unk> tasks for a year .
now , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , for example , this is the example of the <unk> or the <unk> , the <unk> in the ground , are <unk> up to the <unk> .
we 're doing that all in our leisure and live in all germany .
that means that the vast majority of work comes in and on a <unk> .
just three times in the year , we 're going to meet over the year after a <unk> weekend , <unk> , to try and talk about the other problems that showed up , and they 're also important to each other , and that 's
so , to <unk> themselves , 20 to 30 volunteers to have spent their hands for a couple of days or a few weeks of their hands , and you have to touch your help , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
and of course , in these 14 days , the musicians come from .
now you could do this , you would have all about this guy .
but our <unk> goes further .
in fact , we have a huge community in the city that 's built around us around us , in the city , that 's where we want to support us .
this is the classic <unk> , but you 're going to go through a real practical things like this , and for example , we have a baker that gives us a way of bread or a <unk> that gives us fresh food .
and the <unk> will be done in a <unk> <unk> in the city that 's made over the city , and sold .
to the <unk> .
we found in <unk> a whole series of private individuals who provide their living room to be able to samples .
and this is what the marketing is to make a sense of the city in this city , and from people in this city .
they 're identify in a very special way with this article .
so , for the beginning of the year , we 've been able to <unk> support from the citizens of the citizen , which is now a <unk> , which is now <unk> the whole endeavor .
and we burst from the stage , that classical music is that classical music , we put it into the right hands .
that 's why we 're incredibly happy about that all of the young musicians music in your own hand are taking music in their own hand and <unk> home in the cities .
now , if you still can not be able to think of this , like that feels classical music so , you just get over .
so next year , we 're in <unk> , and we would be happy if you 're there .
yes , ladies and gentlemen .
you may think you might be aware of that .
you know , you know , learn to learn to learning , or to the effect of learning , but i mean , for learning , i 'm going to learn how much more and <unk> are <unk> .
knowledge experience <unk> , a beautiful formula for the <unk> .
now , what i learned from art and culture , now , i can tell you a lot of , of course , to say , in fact , now i 'm going to be in this field .
and so i think that maybe i think it may be right to give this something <unk> package of a little bit of <unk> , which is what my talk is .
art is beautiful , but makes a lot of work .
now you 're now laughing now .
you 're always getting the laughter , although most of the ones you know .
why is that ?
and i think that 's to say that in the word that we ca n't grasp it .
art , we sometimes say , that 's what 's going on .
to work , we 're not saying that , which is what happens .
sometimes .
the people who likes to work , that 's what 's for me .
but in work , we think of the <unk> and the art , in the way that we 're moving in , where we move in it , our experience , our own experience .
and so i have my <unk> that i 'd like to share with you about three hours in five pieces that all the headline have , with one i 'm starting to do it for it .
it begins with the <unk> , for childhood , i 'm going to go on to inspiration , i 'm going to tell my youth , i 'm not going to tell all of my youth , no concern , go on , why i 'm going to explain that for my <unk> .
interaction for the first part of my professional life and finally , five , identification .
now , <unk> of them will be these pieces of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , two and <unk> .
you know , you learn that in the first two , three years , if you 've got to practice , and i 've got to practiced .
and so with 10 , 11 , i played these little pieces , on the piano , not far from here , at home .
these pieces are coming from a <unk> .
there 's a melody a melody and the other voice , but it 's quite different .
the rhythm is right , but it 's <unk> .
and that , my ladies and gentlemen , is something <unk> about art , and when it 's just two voices , <unk> , to think that 's the present , the future , the future , the future , in <unk> , in <unk> , things that are
and i learned about this , and i have two melodies , sometimes three , in the <unk> <unk> , at the same way , to play any one , which is one of them who do n't .
and that was what i 've learned , among other things .
i never forget another experience , and i 've had a worry that it might be that it could be so going to me .
i have a piano <unk> , it was more people in the room as today , and in the middle of the <unk> , i came out .
i had forgotten .
i was <unk> .
so again , again , and in the same time , i did n't have to do again .
and the audience was almost more <unk> than i was , because i was in all my feet in my place , got my notes , put it into the house , put it and started the third time .
and you do n't think how to me <unk> .
but that was a very difficult experience .
maybe that 's also one of the experiences that i knew , you know , with piano , although i had a <unk> , i may not go to my <unk> , because you can talk easier .
yes , the next one of my adolescence , i 've got <unk> with inspiration , and i want to tell you stories .
when i was <unk> , i went to my <unk> and told him , i 'd like to play a <unk> .
and he said , `` oliver , '' not .
and you have to have a lot of <unk> schools and have been gathered with women .
now imagine a <unk> man , so , young , a sentence .
i did n't forget that .
and of course , i still practiced more .
i 've been off by the way .
i have practiced , and i remember a situation that i 've never seen more .
it was the <unk> of <unk> by the chopin of chopin , and now i come to the part of work , i just got a place , and she was with the most beautiful , completely wide , and then they went back again again .
i 'm not going to play it now , i 'm not a piano here , and i could n't do it .
i 've played this number 20 , thirty times a couple of times , and all of all , it 's really .
and then i played them on , and i 'm going to be <unk> , i 'm swimming in a ecstasy , and i just know that i was going to leave and laugh .
i was , except .
i had nothing to drink , nothing , and the music did that with me .
so , a experience where i learned , emotions actually really helpful .
and sometimes it 's really right to work for that , you 're going to be in these environments , in this condition , i call it the <unk> .
where all of themselves .
and we actually had this situation in <unk> <unk> in an organization .
and there 's almost everything like that , when we did the <unk> , it 's just a half months , a half , where you would need a year .
well , these were my experiences with the piano , with artistic art .
and now i come to my center , <unk> .
i was first as a musician , but as a <unk> .
we played <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
i 've got <unk> , and i 've been able to focus next to my <unk> for the music and the <unk> .
in the choir , together , breathe , a <unk> , wonderful experiences that i have very , very <unk> .
and then a point where i was in the <unk> theater , i went to the <unk> theater , in the <unk> and the administration , and i got that with <unk> , and i got this <unk> , because this idea came from , from this combination of art , of culture , and i was
because the art , culture , to make my <unk> .
so here 's work for art , but it 's not as artists , but else else would not say , but as a <unk> <unk> and to do something .
i was there in the theater , there was no <unk> <unk> for <unk> , just in vienna , in vienna , and i 've got to do with this question , what can you do with a good management , a good management , a good management of management , a good management
and that was the reason that i 'm not going to stop in my professional workforce , toward this piece of gear , and then i became <unk> .
but before that was another <unk> , and this phase i have a lot of these trials with interaction .
i came up to german <unk> .
the german <unk> has its <unk> in <unk> .
i 'm a <unk> , although sometimes i was born in my <unk> , because i was born in <unk> , and i 'm born in <unk> , who 's always born , the <unk> guy <unk> , i 'm talking about it , i 've got to <unk>
but i have a <unk> root , because my grandparents were also <unk> <unk> , and there , in <unk> , i saw the <unk> .
that was a little bit of what i did n't enjoy , and suddenly i became <unk> in a different form of culture , in a culture of culture , in a culture that was lived in this <unk> device in this <unk> device .
as soon as a result of <unk> on us , all in a completely different situation , in other states .
and i then have <unk> <unk> , who was <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , who was my friend and colleague , and then we 've always been made for the <unk> night music , and i 'd like to <unk> , i could bass bass , for example .
we made the <unk> <unk> , so , but of course , on the air , of course , <unk> <unk> .
and this <unk> , which actually came out of the people .
it was my fate that i learned to be in ninth november for my <unk> , and i do n't do <unk> that the wall fell .
i woke up the next day , i had <unk> examination , oh , the wall is like , yes .
now , i 'm still prepared for any questions for any questions .
and off , i was <unk> for the cities in the <unk> .
and then i have seen how interactions like interactions comes between two german cultures .
actually , we 're talking about the same language , the music will also be wonderful , and it 's been wonderful , but lots of , <unk> .
and unlike the <unk> , it 's not all of the people themselves , but it was a lot of the top , and that 's when i was really comfortable as a great part of what the german identity , i 'm going to get back to
since then , germany would be <unk> .
now , there 's also a lot of a lot of <unk> places in the <unk> .
and that 's interaction , but i 've learned all things here in the city .
so , we have a <unk> that i had a <unk> , imagine that , as i started here , <unk> , stood on my own <unk> and play .
i still have .
both of the time , for <unk> , you do n't want to write <unk> for culture and <unk> .
so i was the first ladder of <unk> .
so , i do n't have a lot of time so much , so it was a wonderful that i had this <unk> , but she was soon because i was in charge of education and make alliances for education and design .
we 've done very much for the urban , we 've been able to see that , if you only see this <unk> between <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , what we have designed to do , the <unk> , where you can experience interactions between art and architecture , the <unk>
many , many interactions , we could , and i could design it , and i could have learned and discover what that means to be able to track different people out of different areas .
and by the way , i realize that i 've always <unk> <unk> of art , and more of the culture that we think of us , of us , of the <unk> between people , between cultures , between the communities , and i 'll go back to the art .
interaction was also between the <unk> the topic when we had a <unk> , seven <unk> of the idea , at <unk> january <unk> , the <unk> could be the <unk> of europe .
but this last chapter , this fifth chapter still has the headline of identification .
this word is two meanings , one , i 'm <unk> with something that 's going to be something , and i can also use it as verb and say , i 'm <unk> that means , i know something .
and it 's always in its <unk> .
i know something with his <unk> , i say , i 'm going to say , i 'm going to be a <unk> or that community .
and i 'm <unk> with something that i 'm going to talk to me and say that i want to identify with me .
and this is a very big action .
and five point to three million people try to move , to identify cities , to identify in the direction of <unk> , to <unk> and identify that you 're a community in europe .
as big , we called it <unk> , but as a community of many people who are in a large <unk> of life , and at least a shared language , and at least a common language , even though , as <unk> nations are here , and this was our core opportunity to start with people 's disease , of course , to take a lot of
the signs of the highway , the highway , many other experiences .
the experience of the <unk> did n't have so many people noted .
so , ham <unk> <unk> and food , two schools , <unk> , young girl from <unk> , from the <unk> , and young students from a <unk> school , <unk> letters of people , <unk> letters , <unk> , love , love , love , love , love , love , love , love , love , love , love , love , love , who wrote the last letters .
and it was a particularly special effect that young girl letters letters from young <unk> quoted and boy , <unk> letters of young men from germany in the previous german german .
and there was one of these young men in the piano , and i was playing this guy that i loved that experiment that i loved .
and i said , `` oh , '' he said , `` i 'm <unk> , he wrote him home as a young german , which he was playing , and i can never play a little bit of <unk> , because my 'm my fingers are <unk> .
and he <unk> his fingers with a <unk> , put it back to the piano in this play on <unk> carl , and tried to play the <unk> .
and it did n't succeed .
so , it was such a <unk> scene that i 'm going to jump up , and i said , what did we learn ?
we have learned that many people can move together together , but all of all things we learned that we 're going to live in peace in peace in peace in peace in peace in peace and the culture of us that we do n't talk about it , because we talk about different languages that we 're looking at each other .
and that was a wonderful experience , and you can see , it 's not just about knowing something .
it 's always about learning to learn something and to win .
and if we 're doing a lot of invent , and let 's tolerate that we 're going to allow it to inspire our own way of art and culture , with the piece of art , when we 're interacting , and eventually we continue to work on our own identity with art and culture , we
and i hope you 're still going to have a lot of <unk> and <unk> that you take this profit .
thank you very much .
yes , thank you very much .
i think we 're waiting for the first picture .
so i 've been talking to <unk> , for the support of my memory , here 's a few slides .
but it 's not a scientific slides , but it 's going to be a way of finding a way of finding a way to find a way to find one direction , and i think , with a topic where i think that 's going to be very much much about .
now , through the <unk> words , i 'll finally know , thank you very much of what ted means , and i think , in the area that we can do this talk .
and then i had heard that you should be able to think of the talk in english , but if you look at this , you see , you see , you see , you can not understand what i wanted to say to english , i did n't know right , and so i left it .
how we 're dying .
i have to tell you the first thing about <unk> .
<unk> was patient in the hospital that i 'd like to get the <unk> <unk> .
she was about <unk> years old , and she always likes to dance in may in may , because she also remembered her husband , who was the first man who was like in war .
and this is the first year , for the first may , and it 's probably a <unk> , and then you probably had a <unk> <unk> , and then he 's left here on the right-hand side , you can see the leg , the <unk> .
so , a couple of years earlier , she was once in the same way , with the same way , with the same way , with the same way , had broken the left leg .
and then , in the time , i was in a doctor , and have been the one of the papers in a intensive care about how they were treated with antibiotics , and the discussion was to see how said , is it make sense ?
do it really makes sense to make sense of such a intense piece of things like that ?
so you know , too , <unk> , in a intensive care , for example , is that a human beings at all ?
and she 's been cured .
five years later , i 'm coming in the clinic , see the name of the name of the name , and i can remember that , because it 's very rare , for the time , again , in the dance
so the question of what i 'm going to do is to say , if i talk about how a human being going to decide , what he was doing in his door , or what 's going on ?
and that 's so little the topic of the <unk> .
so you see the <unk> of the name of what we 're going to die .
it 's a book from <unk> , how we 're going to work , a report in the <unk> .
and then , in the time , the globalization was very strong , so that you 'd ask yourself , how can it go to work ?
you 've got to read , and you can read in this book today , i said , it 's going to be a quality quality of quality , so the pieces are always together .
it 's going to be able to take an connectivity of work , it will also be a lot more powerful , for example , for china , that was a big topic .
and then that 's the way that , basically , the work of the individual , so something that is building something , a little bit of a <unk> , that it 's always changing the quality of the quality that he <unk> .
and that , after my assessment , people were always getting less self-confidence from their work , and more part of a little bit of a little <unk> , where it went to achieve high school , and not about how to define their work .
and if we now transmit this now in the <unk> and medical area , there 's actually a kind of momentum .
if you hear this , you know , what doctors are doing , nurses , and also <unk> in most , of course , they 're the so-called <unk> .
and that 's nothing else when i 've got to be documented when you 've got to be documented , what you 've been doing , so it 's going to be done with it , so it 's going to be done with it , and if you 're not going to be paid at all , and if you 're not documented , you know , the health service , you 're not going to pay health care or this medical treatment .
and by this documentary , but the work is always getting more powerful , and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more , more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and
now , a good friend of me went to the netherlands , because he did n't want that , which was a <unk> practice , which was one <unk> practice , and it 's going to be an accident , and is to lean for a doctor .
and the <unk> are usually a bit of a piece of technology , and he had a little bit of <unk> , and he realized that the martin , i 've seen that there 's more old people in <unk> , and the hospital , and back , because the <unk> does n't know how to do when you get worse .
and then , come into the hospital , get restored , go back to the senior citizens , go back to the senior citizens , or <unk> .
and this one person who was thought that if there 's a little bit like that , i 'd like to make a little bit of comfort , and i want to try to try to train here in order to take a little bit of places that you can see from this <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
now , in the bathroom , he had to recognize that , after he realized , he had learned the language with a lot of difficulty that was happening in the same thing that happened in this stage .
it 's also going to be a quality of quality .
it 's no longer the credibility that counts , but you put it in a <unk> , i want to be put for example , i want to be <unk> or not to the hospital .
and then it 's going to be the <unk> .
i mean , in the course , it 's so , in the third day , a conversation is going on , and then you need to recommend , i want to go into the hospital , or i do n't want to get into the hospital .
so that 's like that , i want to be <unk> or i do n't want to be <unk> .
and this data is then going to a <unk> , and that doctor 's sitting on <unk> , has always been the <unk> , and then the decision decision based on these ground .
now , if we 've been looking at <unk> , who would like to be in may of may the <unk> , and even imagine that eventually , who would have been written a column , i would n't want to be <unk> , and then she could n't experience more .
and that 's a friend of my friend now , who 's sitting there in the holland , too much as much as it 's supposed to deal with .
in the last thing , it 's about <unk> , <unk> percent of people are not dying at home , but in hospitals , and that those rights can be able to mind that you can see , not the ideal <unk> of the old people , but they tend to be very closely <unk> <unk>
there 's a <unk> of people who are doing very well , there are very dubious people that are looking at , but if i look at the <unk> , and we have about 12,000 patients in the year , so about five , <unk> , that may be brought to us ,
and the whole of course , of course , <unk> reasons that is clear , this whole quality of quality of quality , these control of control is therefore , because in the last the last of the money , that all of the money are going to be optimal , and that the people who are going to be able to provide care , and i 'm going to get
now , this is just not the reality , but you need two salaries in <unk> and <unk> , and mostly , it 's just not enough .
so these introduction of quality quality quality of quality quality , as a result of the <unk> market that you want to regulate , so they 're looking at the individual subjects .
and now , i 'm coming now , i 'm going to be able to get from that , so we 're going to do this last , because i 've been asking one of the last questions , and that 's what we do n't think , so that 's what 's the situation of individuals .
and then i just put this to the <unk> , and i think , it 's got a society , because i think a society do always need a society , a legal structure , also legal structures that we have to do with the whole system of what 's happening in our society .
and in the <unk> article , one thing is that it would be <unk> .
and the second sentence there is to protect them up the top of all the <unk> .
and what i 'm not absent , is a third sentence in that , that all of the ones should have been to protect his assignment and defend them .
because it 's a way of making yourself out of this case , i 'm going to admit that , and they 're going to be <unk> and <unk> and then i do n't need to do a thought of how to die .
because in the last one , it 's so , even if we do n't like to ask ourselves that topic , we will come to point at the point .
hopefully late , with a hundred or <unk> .
so , of course , this is , of course , to say , to say , to say , i want to think of that , i want to think , i want to worry about that , and i want to worry about it , but if you 're going to be there , if you 're going to be , you know , if you 're going to be late in your life , it can be late in life , to say , i want to think about
now , if you think about it , what makes my dignity , then you will come to dots where the last come , what is actually the five key things in my life ?
now , there 's a book , which is quite <unk> .
it 's the self-esteem , of course , it 's the friends i have to talk with , and i can exchange with that , and i can talk to life , which is the <unk> .
it 's certainly the trust between people i may have to do with , in <unk> or a pastor or a carrot or a <unk> or a <unk> or another person that i have in relationship with
and there are all a lot of individual factors , of course , that are <unk> there , and i do n't walk now .
but if you look at these three points here , you have to look at a whole lot of tasks , like you might have to be able to be able to stay in your life in order to protect your own dignity .
and then , again , another factor is that we have a certain dictatorship of <unk> , i 've been here as text as an text .
other people can make these decisions for these decisions and this behavior , which is not going to meet .
this is my inner belief .
our dignity can come out of us .
so it 's not the question , which is , what else will do for me , who 's going to drive me , or for me , for me ?
but it 's exactly the other way to ask , where can i talk about people , where i can do , where i can do , i could get my inner inner way that i can deal with these questions , and can make me
and if you 're going to say , how we 're going to work , this inner shape of this quality of quality that has been on us from the outside , it 's an opportunity to say , i 'm going to show me my my inner inner self .
because no person can be <unk> me , how i want to see myself and the <unk> .
and i do n't have to fit into general <unk> , or opinions , who say you 've got to fill up a floor , and because you 're going to try to imagine if you 're going to be <unk> , you want to be in an icu .
and these questions , i can do this last <unk> .
this would be an internal posture that 's in me and that can not be able to protect the outside of the state , which can not protect the state of the state , and not the law , and the other people can be <unk> , and i think i could have been able to have
and to have these conversations , it needs spaces , and i think , and why i 'm talking about this talk , and here 's the spaces like the <unk> in food , and that 's what i 've got to do with these issues , where we have to think about things that is not
so if we 're old , we can say , well , well , yeah , a dance in may , in maybe my may be very high age , that would be even what .
thank you very much for your attention .
beautiful evening .
i get two things .
if you look at the first part , you think a little bit of <unk> .
it 's another second .
so let 's start with infinite .
it 's kind of like , it 's not , you can take .
what do you mean ?
is there different types of <unk> ?
is infinite enough ?
yeah !
that 's not good when one of this is what 's looking at .
so , in fact , but i 'm going to take it off , which you know .
that 's exactly what we do n't do .
we 're just doing with one single one .
and i 'd like to see that , i like to see that a little bit away .
<unk> , <unk> , we know the infinite way to be able to know .
and it 's all about magnitude of magnitude .
when we 're in the jungle , and count two <unk> , in one for example , in the other way , in the other people .
we know , imagine , now we 're looking inside the box , the number is small , it 's three chairs , and it 's three people .
we can check that , if in every amount of same number of elements is inside ?
count , how would we do it ?
that means that we would only be <unk> , one , two , three , we count , three chairs , one , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , and three .
what you mean , yes ?
very beautiful .
this is a wonderful thing that works in the universe that works in large numbers , although it 's shining .
but it matches .
how can you count it ?
so how do you see that many people like chairs ?
i 've got aware of chairs and people and not what else .
<unk> !
you call the mate !
you know , you know , that 's clearly , not , now we 're in the morning , and you 've all seen that .
not , that 's very beautiful .
so , you know , you call it a professional <unk> , and it works as well , yes ?
you take one , put them on a chair , out of the mouse .
the next <unk> , the next thing , the next <unk> , everything is doing , there 's a little bit different people , no chair remains empty , ok ?
now we go into infinity .
how can we compare two infinite sets ?
we would say that one is so big or bigger or smaller than the other .
we could do it ?
we would start to start back again .
right , that 's wrong , because the point is when you start on an infinite way to count , yes , i 'd just say you 're not to another .
<unk> , infinitely , is clear , <unk> ?
so how is it ?
<unk> ?
no way .
and she was really started .
mate !
so , now let 's look at this .
estimate , value is always bad , yes ?
you do n't see you , yes ?
the point is this , you make it easy .
for example , i 'm going to take natural numbers , <unk> , <unk> , we need the zero zero to start , zero , one , two , four , five .
and we would have , let 's say , you know , a copy of this <unk> , and take one of these copy , the infinite number of <unk> figures .
i 'm going to stay on . okay , zero , two , six , six , eight ?
okay ?
all straight numbers are <unk> on the infinitely long <unk> of the natural numbers , but on the one of the band , the <unk> is missing the <unk> , on the other , the straight and the <unk> .
so let 's call a lot of g of the linear numbers , call us the other amount of social numbers .
what do you think ?
is g more powerful , is it bigger than n , right now , right ?
right ?
but it 's very well , yeah , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
who is another estimate ?
smaller ?
who 's bigger ?
ah , that really does n't have a plan , yes ?
you can not be it , yes ?
you know , you ca n't , where what 's missing , that does n't matter ?
okay , you say smaller ?
would you think , not ?
that 's the popular thing , which is , of course , is wrong .
and now i 'm going to explain why the quantities are alike .
how does it work ?
right .
yes , we mate .
that 's the point .
we mate .
we take the zero out of the straight amount , we take zero out of the natural crowd , mate , out .
so the next one of zero , after plus two , two , comes to zero one , and i get a <unk> .
the four , the two , the six , the six , the eight , the four , yes ?
you can revert that , then you 're doubling , that 's clearly , <unk> ?
and so clearly , by the <unk> , we can make it that i always do it in the lecture .
and here one , there 's just the straight line , and the band is right , yes ?
we <unk> the natural gas on the straight , <unk> , the <unk> are gone , and the band is still going to be right now .
that 's just in infinite .
so , if you 've learned some things that we learned today , infinity , what 's infinite , i do n't know ?
an infinite amount has an infinite feature , which is not a tremendous feature that is not the proof of the present , is absolute <unk> , a real subset that is right .
and that 's not the way you do n't think of that , if you can pull two three people out of three people two people , it 's just one there and before .
yes , we did infinity .
is no <unk> ?
okay .
we 're going to do a second part , probably probability .
the professionals , the <unk> probability .
here 's what brought up here .
i 'm sure with this experiment , i 'm sure , is at least a third of the know , and i do n't think anybody doing that , yes ?
so , call the doors a , b , c .
i 've got hidden behind anything , i hope you do n't hear it .
and you 're supposed to be here now .
where you , i mean , i have hidden , behind a , b or c ?
guess , here , our <unk> , here .
you estimate c .
who has another idea ?
a ?
who has another idea ?
okay , <unk> , b does n't have no , you know , if you never stop ?
that 's right .
it really does n't matter , so you do n't have to be my mean , the three characters will fall , and i 'm looking for me .
it 's really no matter , yes ?
it 's completely clear because , you know , that 's the chance you 're lucky , it 's just about a third .
<unk> , there 's three things , it 's really no matter , yes ?
now i 'm going to do this , i 'm going to do one .
well , i know , of course , where it is .
<unk> , that has somebody else , <unk> .
so , i know , i know where it 's because , and the guess and the guess , or what you call it is , in a second round .
so , i 'm actually really the game , i 'm actually now <unk> now .
so it 's so , we go into a second round .
now , assumed , i 'm <unk> on this a , <unk> ?
so , i have to show a door behind it , and it 's not because they 're not saying .
because now , if you say b , and i say , and i know it 's not behind b .
then there 's not a second round of it .
then i say , `` <unk> , '' from the mouse , sorry .
but i have to leave you , that 's <unk> , in the second round .
so i can only have a open open , but it 's not not just but what they 're not saying .
now , the question is , and this is the most important probability , among the condition here , there is one of the condition that is open , that b is open , and it 's not behind you now , you have their last chance
you 're now allowed to stay in a , then i need a <unk> .
i 'm doing now what you want .
or you say , i 'm doing c .
now , the problem is , is now it has become more likely to be more more likely ?
phew , very beautiful , b is on , i know it 's behind c .
or , you know , god is to be that b has been open , i always wanted to stay with a stay , which is it .
or you 'd say , `` well , you know , we have <unk> , <unk> , right now , we have just two doors , and it 's not going to change or stay .
what do you mean ?
it does n't matter .
<unk> .
why does n't it matter ?
very beautiful .
why is it <unk> ?
yes , that 's false .
this is almost almost when we had <unk> it yesterday , <unk> ?
but they are , <unk> , are a new no , fun .
so , this is a <unk> , yes .
you know , that 's all between , i do n't know , six and , i 'm not allowed to come in , otherwise , i 'm not going to come on ,
so , you know , really everybody .
behind this door , it 's been to a third .
and it 's always just to a third behind a door .
you can guess what you want , you have two thirds of you in the dirt .
that means that you would have can think of two doors , not , you can do with <unk> , you can put on <unk> , you can put there on two dozen , you can be on two dozen , you can be on two dozen , you can be <unk> , if you have zero <unk> , that 's all in the right life .
but here 's just a door .
so , here 's what , now , two thirds is not what you guess .
so the two third here is , but it can be just behind a door .
it 's not .
so , what 's more ?
no way i 'm really hidden .
so what 's more likely to get ?
it 's better to stay , or change ?
now it 's just , yes ?
yes , of course .
so , that 's not hard , <unk> ?
ha !
what do we see ?
they have been <unk> .
why ?
it 's just not a hundred percent , the difference between theory and practice .
i hope it was for everybody .
thank you very much .
mr. <unk> that they <unk> me to jamie oliver <unk> , which is just about bad food and bad food , and overweight people , depressed the depressed .
but i mean , my best of my best that this was all more gone back , these experiences .
i mean , i come from <unk> farm , and i knew until i had 12 mcdonald 's .
that 's what went on , right ?
yes , yes .
thank you very much .
i grew up there .
and i do n't know if mr. <unk> came on to ask me , to ask me if i want to talk about the ted on the lake and talk about a particular particular topic .
i 've got to have <unk> myself : the topic .
sure , motivation is not bad , and i 'm <unk> the woman who said , i think , maybe one of the ones that i 'd like to do or another sport .
i 've also been full of that .
so now , i 'm going to go at the rain now , now to go to the rain now , now , a lot of , but i 've got to train tomorrow , because i want to take a <unk> , the <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> -- that 's <unk> miles .
i 'm going to do this morning , i 'm not going to pick the training .
so who wants to take on , `` <unk> , go tomorrow early . ''
i 've been saying , `` short , i 'm going to be able to trust it . ''
and i started , <unk> , with the topic of <unk> .
do n't worry , nice , little <unk> , blind trust is coming up afterwards .
i tried to think about i tried to think about it , when i am <unk> , how do i describe to describe where i 'm say'n ?
so , i 'm going to come from a minute of <unk> village , many <unk> , some <unk> , and my parents on the farm 's apple 's apple , <unk> and <unk> -- and what you do
in sport , in sport , of course , not in the <unk> , but i think , <unk> and beer .
why do i tell the story where i come from ?
for me , one of the very important stories that i really grew from the country from the village and grew up with two great brothers , with the oldest brother , who is <unk> .
and with the second brother , which is as blind as i am .
you know , that 's what 's going to be light and dark , and that can also recognize where <unk> windows in the space is whether it 's light or out of it .
so , what 's very practical for the <unk> .
and the one , or we can see you can see , when you see anything else .
<unk> <unk> , but i 'm always going to say , is <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the topic of old men , <unk> .
there 's always over time .
but what i 've always been important is , of course , is actually the fact , of course , is the fact that you trust trust , and you can see that great trust , that we need all of a little bit of <unk> as a <unk> situation , tell you .
and it 's definitely not because of my parents , it 's like many of them , before my brother and me still knew no blind .
we were so the first ones that we have relatively suddenly in their lives .
and then they had to kind of do what they did .
and , now , i 'm <unk> , i 'm a tremendous lucky that my parents were not going to be all day , to go up to us and say , there 's <unk> wall , and then you can feel
we have been a uncomfortable -- we have <unk> home .
and b , our parents come from us to go to the beginning of all of us , always to go there , where our career is brother .
so , in the house , <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> , it will be safe .
there 's the blind son , then , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> i have to have today .
so , with the great brothers -- they 're not just good for the teeth but for the <unk> .
and our brothers and my brothers and my brothers , and i was looking at <unk> , and my brothers , and i mean , `` <unk> '' and so , in <unk> , '' and i really put out of the <unk> city , i really did n't know what 's going to do , what ma is , for example , for example .
and that 's what <unk> brother with desire , with three years , and then we wanted to , of course , michael and i .
and then they started to drive with <unk> , like many little children , today , with <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
to the <unk> .
but we still started with <unk> , sometime without .
and then the big question is : how <unk> ma is there ?
and how do you get the trust , one of the trust of the parents that you have to go back to the bike , and <unk> and on the other hand , and the trust of us that we do n't increase where to go .
and our solution was that , of course , we 're going to have our parents to say , where are the <unk> , so where 's a car , where <unk> <unk> is , where are you going to be able to do -- you know , you know -- we knew that
and we had to remember that in between , but the one of the one is the other .
and you can not test that in this way , not all of them , because it 's going to be a little bit of it .
but <unk> ' evening , if you can turn it up , and you can do it in your bedroom , and you still want to you .
can you try to be able to do , just <unk> <unk> with your tongue , and you can find that in people , it 's also like bats -- you 're going to hear a resistance .
so like the bats that you 're going to hear , you 're going to hear you hear the <unk> , <unk> wall , <unk> resistance because of sound will be <unk> .
and this is for me to trust me , so trust .
but in fact , poor people have been getting <unk> and safety , i got the <unk> chance of helping me .
and i 'm going to deal with that , and you know , there 's no big problem , and sure , without many accidents , one or another .
in fact , what i do n't have to do today , is that i 've got a lot of <unk> themselves , from one of our <unk> things as children .
so , from the climb of the climb climb on our higher <unk> ,
i wrote here , the confidence grows through a <unk> diversity .
and i 'm going to say that i 've been very literally , because i 'm going to be a person , who 's going to be a lot of <unk> in the <unk> , and in the <unk> of trust in the science of my science , '' i 'm never going to be yes , and i 've experienced
you 've never read the same way .
but certainly , however , certainly , of course , can not be able to experience any of the same , of course .
now , diversity , in the state of our strengths , to the <unk> , to know where i 'm good , what am i doing , and where am i going to have a talent and where i 'm going to be full of
and our brother , again , he has michael and kept me back to roofs from the house .
so then , then i said , okay , we <unk> here .
you know , there 's a <unk> window , and you can see that you can go out of the <unk> .
and then , the <unk> went off , michael towers , and i probably had a little bit of <unk> like the girl , <unk> <unk> , i do n't know .
but after all , who 's going to be the bottom ?
so i do n't .
and i mean , i think of the other , we 're not the generation of young women here , too .
and that 's why i 'm always with .
and then , you know , the consequence that we 're going to sat up at some three pieces of <unk> , and you know , dad with <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> , and no longer knew what he 's supposed to say .
because of course , that 's the way , of course , is , if other doubt .
so the father would have said , about god 's will , help help , help you know , the danger of the danger that one of us have been relatively important , that one of us would have <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- i do n't know -- sort of
it 's never happening .
he always had to feel like he was going to be <unk> for us to get <unk> or <unk> <unk> that 's informed us .
and that was what i found for me , we had this opportunity .
but clear , no concern , that 's not a value , no necessary to do <unk> later .
i mean , for me , the different sports that were always important in my life , all of these things .
and all of all , they were <unk> because i could also see : where i am my boundaries , which may be my favorite .
so , to <unk> good <unk> .
i 've never had the <unk> .
and i 'm not going to go back to the background today .
i 'm going to go back to the dead today .
now , not at five degrees right now .
and at <unk> rain -- but still even being inside the inside .
but i always have that trust to my strengths in my strengths that i try to try and try .
for example , for example , <unk> .
and that was very nice for me , because the coaches that told us that he was saying , ok , we <unk> <unk> children , but send them send <unk> some blind children .
and actually , it 's good because there 's been a little twist to you anyway .
and then you see what the other does .
and there 's always my big trust , of course , i think , if i 'm going to do the competition , it 's hard to do it , because the other maybe can do what i 'm not going to do .
so there 's just one way , and that 's the trust in my <unk> .
in the other hand , the other hand goes into the <unk> , let me go back to myself -- and then he goes down , and it 's at the back and the competition is over , because 's the full score .
i do n't try to try it .
i had been thinking about it .
i mean , that 's <unk> <unk> .
and i did n't have any volunteers , right ?
<unk> .
sorry .
okay .
so the next thing for me is important , as a sports , then the <unk> , and just <unk> .
my parents were home or are up to the day today , and they were taught us as children .
but for me , i was always important for school , how can i get to move to school as much for school to get rid of my excess energy ?
and then , i had a way to do in school .
and even though i was actually thinking , that 's all the boring boring , because <unk> is something like the <unk> , <unk> .
i used to be -- <unk> , i do n't know .
i then have said to say , well , i 'm going to do with you .
and then , you know , then , you know , human beings , again , that is the great diversity here in the sport , because you need to be <unk> , you need power , <unk> coordination and it 's <unk> extreme <unk> .
<unk> -- you probably have a lot of your work from your work ?
that 's what it 's in the <unk> .
you will only be quickly when you have the full trust in your own technology .
if you have the trust in your own power -- the force that you can actually be in any conditions , the bad weather , to soft snow , in <unk> snow .
and if you 're in my case in my case , it 's also trust .
because as a <unk> , which is nothing , i 'm obviously <unk> .
and i 've never been going to do this -- i 've got to use the word -- i 've got to use the word -- my <unk> -- there 's been one -- i 've done my practice today .
do nothing , we do it again .
now , if i 'm going to do a moment , maybe you 're just going to be just a moment .
put one , one , one of them later another exercise .
and what i 'm going to do is to do with the issue of faith , which is the exercise that i 'm going to leave the audience to talk about how it 's like this , if you do n't think of it , you know , when you do n't think of it , you know , when you do n't know
so in the <unk> hand , you know , you have two sticks in your hand .
so from that , clear , i 'm not going to free , otherwise , otherwise i could take my favorite <unk> and feel like that .
it 's not .
so i need to help me different .
i then got my own sense of doing that .
and that explains me with the voice .
so it 's always going to be able to do this .
and that 's important for trust .
the precision in communication , so in the <unk> .
and the <unk> message that i 'm always saying , when 's going to be <unk> , who says , `` <unk> , '' which says , `` on the left , i 'm going to say , on the left , i know it 's easy to the left
if he says , on the left , on the left to the left , and when he says , right ?
okay , all right ?
then <unk> <unk> problem , because then i need to say again , and he 's got to sorry again , i 'm going to say again , i 'm going to know what 's not .
and for me , it 's very big , i 'm really important , i 'm really important , i 'm really important , i 'm really important , i 'm really important , i 'm really important , i 'm really going to be able to say , i have to say i really got to say to you .
so to say , it 's a positive story for me to be the tools that allows me to be quickly , and also faster than others that start in the same competition .
and i can only do that , if i 'm able to do this , with two arms , i 'm going to be able to stand on a leg , and i 'm really going to make the eyes , ha do n't get open .
and then you have to be <unk> , and then got to stand on the other leg and again , and can be <unk> here .
also with high shoes .
yes , and this is really important for me , when i 'm going to say , i 'm going to say , like i 'm going to say , `` like , i 'm going to say the guy , i say , `` you know , i 'm going to tell you guys , '' because i 'm actually going to say , `` hey , you know , hey , you know , hey , you know , hey , you know , hey you 've got to do the right problem
so i do n't know what he needs to say .
so i 'm the one that we have to open up to communications .
and it 's like every single <unk> .
if somebody does n't know my needs , he can not help me , but there 's been a good job , and have to say , well , i need to say , `` well , i need to need to need to have a need . ''
or i need to take a practice of you as if you 're looking at me , you know , i 'm going to say , like , how long of the mountain is still , because if we <unk> the <unk> , you think it 's going to be over .
and so again , again , just like <unk> , and it does n't stop .
and then , there 's a lot of the pilot that 's going to be on the pilot , like it 's going to be in a minute of <unk> , and then we just tell you , unfortunately , we may -- so , again , so , again , <unk> minutes
so , i think , that 's important for me to have the exact clear , important <unk> .
i 'm going to listen to the <unk> -- here 's the other one that 's going to drive on <unk> <unk> ?
who is more ?
so my best time has been faster , but i was in september , and now in april , i 've never been able to be able to be honest , too much faster .
and at the moment , the <unk> are very <unk> .
and for me , as i said , these things are just possible when i can open my ears open .
the other one of me just explaining what he sees about , and i think , is the potential to my risks .
and this is one of the very important things that i say , and trust is rather training , and not this <unk> <unk> .
so , i 'm not going to stop now , as a blind thing , i do n't want to say , `` frankly , '' from <unk> .
because i 've also had the experience that i also had a <unk> right and left on the left .
and then that was bad at the competition at the competition at the time , because it 's next to three meters <unk> .
and i 'm the three feet .
so , that 's why -- as said , that was <unk> .
i also know that , because the <unk> , you 've got to move , so , <unk> .
and i 'm going to talk to me today , people say , to say , to say , on the left , and then say , `` <unk> , the other left .
so , then i was right .
it often does n't often do that much .
but sure , in <unk> situation , pressure , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , probably all of the work or the college like even when you have to go quickly .
and then , of course , precision is , of course , is <unk> difficult challenge .
but for me , as i said , is that i need to be able to recognize the risks .
and i 've got to be honest , i 'm someone who 's not as somebody who do n't see relatively important in the advantage because i 'm <unk> my risks in many ways .
so if you 're going to <unk> <unk> , i 'm going to do that .
from the driving tree , the tree 's tree will be <unk> down to <unk> , which i know , and , of course , -- and that 's the important thing -- i 'm going to <unk> the good pages .
and that 's where the trust can be achieved , if you have that trust .
and if you found somebody that actually actually have a hundred percent of the way that i need .
and that 's what i 've been doing with all the same goals .
because that 's the next thing i want to trust in the topic of trust .
you need the same goal , and i really need to be clear , so what is it really to take to take trust ?
because that 's a lot of things that you used to be used to do .
i trust the or trust or myself .
but this is a very important thing that is also much on it .
that 's what you do for trust .
and you know , you know , because we can do things with <unk> <unk> -- we want to look at the <unk> level behind it .
and the sense of that is very often that we can also create a <unk> goal .
so that we can do -- in my case , for example , a couple of people , i 've gone to the <unk> .
and i mean , `` well , '' i mean , i 've got to look for somebody to look for , or that i can get in the case , i 'm going to get that mountain up .
and how do you do that you have a point on the mountain ?
well , well , i realized , i had this huge advantage , i did n't see some things now , i do n't see some things .
i was a relatively <unk> .
so , can be an advantage , that 's not a problem .
and i 've been working on the fear of memory , and i 'm going to be independent by the <unk> , i 'm going to go down , and then i put this out of <unk> <unk> or <unk> in berlin <unk> , you will be <unk> <unk> <unk> .
now , this is a little bit of <unk> <unk> , if you 're there , and you can hear the car on the bottom , you do n't have to see a lot of it , you have to know , i hurt it .
and these things have been interesting for me .
now , you know , you know , you know , you know , too , too , too , too , i think , i 'm going to know , hey , i 'm going to get war in the way that i 'm going to focus , and i can just get <unk> new new experience .
and exactly the <unk> <unk> little <unk> at <unk> , because there 's a little bit of <unk> <unk> , so you 're going to go every day 10 hours a day .
you 're going to go and go , it 's still more stones around them , fewer plants .
you take a <unk> <unk> , <unk> gun , <unk> <unk> .
so if you look at the <unk> list , the <unk> is about the last one , of the <unk> .
that 's the only exciting thing .
we just saw the steel from the distance , or the other way .
so , i mean , i mean , `` i '' '' i 've got a big trust trust in the <unk> -- despite his strange <unk> that he had .
because i thought i thought , well , like i said , `` well , as said , i 'm probably going to be faster , like this thing .
but as i said , it 's otherwise rather , because you 're not going to be really much right now now .
and it 's going to be really exciting , if you will .
so if you go into the altitude , and the air is thinner .
or if it 's next to a <unk> , if you 're going to have a <unk> camera , which is where it 's on the left and right .
and then it 's just beautiful , and if it 's all night , and then everybody 's <unk> is all about <unk> , sometimes he 's sometimes said , well , he would take me to take a wire , so he 's
because i 'm going to be there as a single without <unk> , and that 's what it was like to be a moment , sometimes it 's sometimes <unk> .
and so trust , we created that i was saying i said , well , i can say , well , i can say , well , i can , of course , i can say , of course , my company , my girlfriend , that was about a hundred percent , i 'm <unk> .
but i also need to have to have a <unk> form of safety , so i do n't have to change , because , can you imagine if you 're going to say , if you 're going to say , if you 're going to say , if you 're on the mountain , <unk> stone , on one , left on 11 .
you know , you 're going to be <unk> , and that 's all the way .
so , for us , this is trust in the case , we 're looking for <unk> , so <unk> we had a rope on their backpack , which i had in the hand of <unk> .
now , in the other hand , i 'd like to do that , i 've got a little bit of altitude altitude of the altitude of the steps .
and she 's at some point of <unk> with the foot <unk> , or <unk> with her <unk> <unk> , that i 've been able to see what 's going on .
and what i actually really showed that really is how beautiful it is , of course , when you look at this , then , you know , there 's to be a little bit of the peaks that you 're going to get here again , that you can actually get the same thing that you can do with
but on the other hand , it 's also that i realized that trust , i mean , that i have that trust , that i 'm going to be in me , that 's not only because i really have the peaks like that .
but that 's the trust that trust is in other words , the <unk> that is working .
now , when we were <unk> the mountain of the mountain of the mountain , we were mostly in the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group , and the other seven people went in the other seven subjects , and they were still relatively close behind us , and it was somebody else , and i thought , `` well , say , why is the same thing that you can walk behind the
and you can not look at the girls at the back .
it seems not the reason .
and then , i realized , i realized , ah , yeah , you know , you know , you know , you know , that trust your trust is kind of <unk> .
you go through the darkness , you go to 12 o'clock , then you have no light .
it 's totally defeated , if you 're <unk> , the air will be thin , so it 's actually just tiring and now not anymore .
and then , at the moment , the moment that you have said , `` yes , this is actually totally practical , behind you , because the friend of my friend of my friend of mine has all about , we have to get <unk> -- how the women are doing .
and the whole night , all the night told us something like , and the other people in the group of the group , had exactly because of the fun of the <unk> , you know , to know , ok , it 's just <unk> hour , which has been told me .
or i did n't tell you what 's going to tell you about the mountain .
and exactly that , you know , you know , somebody else , which may be very bad about it , we may have been talking about it -- it 's just been <unk> hour , the sun is coming .
and right now , these things that can be able to mirror it from the outside , trust and can contribute that you can do that , you have to get your personal gold medal .
and i mean , for me , trust is that , and then is perfectly perfect , if you want to get your personal gold medal and the idea that you want to get in , then there is really there .
so , of course , this is clear , in sports , in the sports that you know -- i actually do n't know why , i do n't know how to do -- i do n't know , i do n't know how to test the value , or to see if it 's got <unk> ?
so , i mean , i mean , in some of the medals , it 's so , in vancouver , they were very difficult to do it .
if this is all real gold , i 'm not going to do here , then i would be on the <unk> , i think .
or at least , in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
but as i said , `` what you do is that you can imagine that you can imagine : what am i actually created , and how have i created my ability and forces on a point .
i 'm in my ability to my ability in my ability , but of course , in the team that we all need , in terms of time , in the job .
it does n't matter if old man or young woman , we need people to be able to trust .
and then , if we actually have this goal in front of the head , and you have it , you know , that 's the best evidence that we could trust at least in a project .
and once you can once , it 's definitely in other areas .
thank you very much .
a science for me , this is the title of my talk , which is after <unk> their beautiful cards .
so what drives me , is the most important effort to be the science again , again , in the general population .
basically , i could be satisfied .
if i <unk> in a <unk> , there 's been a <unk> literature , with science issues that is <unk> .
and even everybody else has a whole range of <unk> materials , magazines , <unk> , where scientific topics , <unk> topics , kind of , sort of
all of these tv tv has at least a <unk> , where kind of scientific topics .
even , that 's completely <unk> , if you look at what you look at , what about magazines and <unk> for children with science issues .
and every program , there 's kind of a <unk> in <unk> , but yet it 's such a pure <unk> story .
science is one of the things that can like to look at that , i can like to read , but that 's not about that .
cool , science is just kind of just at csi , in <unk> , in the <unk> , somewhere , there 's the chemists .
now at csi , a <unk> five minutes , has nothing to do with reality , but that 's cool , <unk> ?
there i can identify .
big bang , i can laugh , i can laugh it , i do n't understand the jokes , but it 's great .
it 's extremely shame .
because , that 's kind of a little bit of paradox , the future , we 're just going to solve , with such technological issues and topics .
but at the same time , no way .
i 've got a couple of little examples of how science or science just just have one of us .
and in london , in london , you built a beautiful tower , <unk> , the architect , again , we 're building that kind of kind of <unk> that way .
now , what 's happening is now that the sunlight side is drops by the top of the house , i 've got a <unk> , and then in a way , somewhere in a point
and the big big deal with the press , there 's just a jaguar .
shame , the heat has so <unk> that this poor <unk> , which has really happened for a long time , long , there 's the nest union .
and then you wonder , an architect , who did n't actually learn a little bit of things in physics , because i mean , i mean , is totally new that <unk> so much things .
so , what i found is , is <unk> , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of <unk> , where he was using sugar .
i mean , really , what has the more design , or architect or where did he study ?
now here 's a very short example .
you know , a <unk> that you have in terms of such topics is also the <unk> .
so <unk> , this is now a couple of years ago , when that was in the media .
there was the train , because <unk> changed plants , that was a danger .
genes was a green <unk> .
genes were kind of a bad bad hand .
<unk> , oh , there are genes in .
there were moments where the market were really getting farmers , hey , i have <unk> vegetables .
no idea what that is to be , yes .
so , yes , okay , a <unk> tomatoes , we can discuss it .
but at the time , i was still in the lab in the laboratory , and was totally frustrated because i tried to get this evil genes into my bacteria , this <unk> <unk> .
and was totally frustrated , came home , and my <unk> , <unk> , you 're not happy looking at what is going on ?
i 'm like , yes , i 'm going to try to transform this for three days in my bacteria , and it does n't work .
that was what i tried to explain , so somehow , a <unk> , gene , i thought , yes , the good lady when i talk about genes , you know what she means .
so this was what i was doing , so a certain sequence that i wanted to get into these <unk> .
but that was what the wife has perceived .
this woman never <unk> me .
who knows what i 'm going to do , <unk> ?
genes is what 's very bad .
so this is now 10 years ago , and yet that has somehow in consciousness .
genes , that 's something bad .
i did n't read a long time .
it 's always free technology , and it 's really really in our language .
<unk> can be a headline .
<unk> is a lot of different corn that contains all the genes .
another headline , <unk> rats are dying .
yeah , that 's also a beautiful headline .
but they are not that old , and it 's also relatively much no matter where i can be a way .
it does n't matter if the time or the picture , all of the <unk> .
fortunately , it 's not going to be <unk> in <unk> , but i 'm afraid that is not going to be more long .
but it simply shows what uncertainty in the population is in the population , because they 're just not aware of the topics .
now , nevertheless , we need to be engaged in our future with these technologies .
now , it was <unk> , no one had the big on the topic , but they 're going to be on things .
and that 's pretty sad .
how does this work from the laboratory in the laboratory ?
so if we think that little , boy , motivated scientists sitting in his lab , an experiment , a little bit , beautiful , and good , that 's what 's going to be interested in the public .
and then the one has to go to the professor .
the boss that decides , ok , ok , cool topic , releases his name as a <unk> , which is always important in science , <unk> .
good idea , i 'm still not in public , it 's going to be a <unk> .
yes , the <unk> think , oh , great idea , great , there 's a <unk> <unk> .
so , <unk> , we have a <unk> with a project , a beautiful idea , and then it comes out of the <unk> .
so that 's going to be <unk> , yes , but who actually is ?
now , the institute are rare alone , usually several characters , have a common tool .
and from all these lines , the <unk> , the really cool projects , then they 're giving up to the magazine magazine , the <unk> , whether it 's <unk> , <unk> or <unk> .
that 's the way .
and then , from the ground , it will continue to move into <unk> , in <unk> , really cool experiments , the really <unk> projects that show up in these <unk> .
so , that 's a very much good magazine magazine , who are really good , there 's really good , there 's all of all there is free , yes , but who are i going to get with this ?
basically , that 's just what 's interested in .
in the <unk> , we 're always using the <unk> of the <unk> .
so , you know , you know , it 's going to be interested in this anyway , which is still the newspaper , yes , beautiful and good .
so nice magazine , you 're going to be interested in , which may be interested in , and that may have been about a clue where <unk> goes in this article .
now , who do i mean ?
the <unk> that it 's interested in .
i mean , that was now , i 'd like to call it <unk> , i call it a little bit of <unk> <unk> , who was picking up under this circumstances of other publications , i tried to think it 's <unk> .
yet , again , our future , we can only be able to be there , if we 're doing with these trade-offs .
fracking , <unk> , renewable energy , <unk> , <unk> , these are all kinds of topics that are <unk> , who do n't really understand , and that 's supposed to be able to vote .
my project , my idea is to be different <unk> , these little , happy scientists to take out of the <unk> , to separate and give him a course , a seminar .
so , what 's largely happened that a scientists have a buddy , we 've been talking about 20 years ago , it 's <unk> , it 's a <unk> for us to ask him for his job .
and once he <unk> the mouth and he talked about his job , he was telling us a lot .
<unk> , these are scientists who tell you what about <unk> .
<unk> , hear a <unk> , <unk> , switzerland is already almost as much as genes .
<unk> treated , that 's kind of , oh , you do n't know what is behind .
really , really , go back , you know , that 's beautiful and good when you 're on a conference and you 're going to tell you you want to tell your <unk> , your <unk> , to tell you to talk about , you 'd like to tell you to talk to you to tell you to tell you to talk to you , but glimpse , say , `` rejection ''
where is the problem , it 's really <unk> and talk about normal ?
so i was working school , this is my idea , these young scientists , who are not so far in the hierarchy , who are still a little bit malleable , the school i mean , how to say .
that has to be able to use any one , <unk> , whatever you want to know , to know what 's happening in the brain .
finally , that 's the bad man who are using that , so it 's actually actually going to be able to communicate with the <unk> .
but these training training , that 's just a story .
i 'm going to take you a jury , and i want you to imagine her project , your project , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , can not be , worse .
there 's a quote , i do n't know if this is real , <unk> einstein : if you ca n't just explain it , you have n't really understood it .
so , to take the scientists out of the lab and really rethink their project , how can i truly be able to communicate it ?
so , there 's a lot of stories .
<unk> are totally modern , is everywhere , in every university , common , but i 'm actually going to get back in the <unk> .
who 's at the end of the city in the university of the city in the university of the city in university in the university of the city in the university of the city , and i 'm going to take a talk to a lecture ?
these are the ones it 's doing anyway .
i 've got my <unk> again .
so , these are the people who are interested in , they 're going to go there , and they 're going to listen to a couple of talks .
so , that 's beautiful , there are any <unk> , all of you are happy , all of you are happy , drive home .
so , i 'm interpreting in a second thing to say , to say , i 'm not going to say , it 's not in the <unk> of the project .
now , these scientists are also trained to be trained to <unk> <unk> .
because many really <unk> have really <unk> to reduce the substance .
because scientists , like studying the research , and how kids study their world , it 's identical .
so children work very extremely scientific .
they do something like that .
you try to taste what , does this work ?
<unk> , fall , no way , does n't work , next iteration , i change a bunch of parameters , make it even new .
children learn extremely scientific .
these are really <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , i 'm <unk> , what happens , which i need to change is that it works or not .
this is normal .
but they have a lot of <unk> .
and so , from that , i think , really , really , i can work , if you get the <unk> , and these scientists permanent permanent in the neighborhood in the environment with school in the environment with school , from elementary school , together with the <unk> , and i 'm really afraid that
and then you may be , maybe sometime , that 's so my hope , the kids , do n't tell you the same , and then i get <unk> <unk> , who 's going to be interested in scientific topics , because the children will tell him .
this is not somewhere in the newspaper , which is not in galileo , but his kids tell him something that <unk> mirror <unk> with a <unk> , that it has a bread of <unk> , and then you know , and hear your head
and not only i just get , of course , i 'm going to be a <unk> , but also the <unk> .
this is my idea , my vision , my project .
unfortunately , it 's just <unk> that the first <unk> that i 've called , yes , no , no , <unk> for our scientists that is just not topic , which is just about other priorities .
a scientist has to be able to communicate .
i think , i think , okay , i 'm going to call the next one .
but who somehow works in a institute , <unk> is in a company , like , there 's just the next way .
thank you very much .
i 'm crazy .
you ca n't travel every day .
the last few weeks were awful .
the weather has made a big map of the bill .
seven , eight years ago i have been wondering if i want to take here .
i was in the ceo , almost 10 years , with the <unk> <unk> in <unk> and in <unk> .
we have come up here .
<unk> as customer .
and for me , that was actually more , well , this is <unk> .
so , what does it do ?
<unk> , that 's actually really ridiculous .
but i 've got some of the ones that i learned to be behind who is , and i 'm standing here today .
and yeah , it may be a little crazy , but it 's also very high .
it 's beautiful , and it 's always exciting , and you make great fun .
and i 'm going to tell you to the next <unk> , <unk> minutes , a little bit of a <unk> of a life .
i am the ceo in the <unk> .
the company is there for a hundred and <unk> .
i 'm ceo of the <unk> .
this company is for 20 years .
and managing the <unk> .
the company has been about <unk> or <unk> .
that runs the zeppelin here at the <unk> .
zeppelin .
and this is a picture that i want to show you , the little bit of right , which is actually a red , <unk> on it , or anything else , that 's exactly that point is still big .
this is the world , in fact , is just <unk> .
and these are actually only 10 .
so that 's already what you see .
there 's about 20 thousand <unk> worldwide .
so this is not a market .
it 's not even a secret .
this is a <unk> , a <unk> .
and the question is , why do you do that ?
how do it do ?
and <unk> in the government , and only 10 , you can talk about why that is .
quickly to history .
<unk> has a <unk> <unk> <unk> the aviation .
very short .
this is led to <unk> 14 14 minutes before the first world war ii .
then in the first world war , the world war , <unk> zeppelin died of <unk> , by the way , was <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
then they have <unk> , and so on and so forth .
and when we got <unk> and eight to london , and with a big <unk> there , to fly a <unk> campaign , the english newspaper <unk> full of the headline with the headline : this is not about bombs , but in an accident .
so , the story has been in <unk> .
and we had <unk> campaign .
but <unk> , the client , was not so pleased because he suddenly realized that there was even behind the old memories in there .
and so , that 's a little bit for the marketing .
but anyway , it was a good campaign in london , except the weather in the north , there was very bad and very <unk> .
and we 're not flown very much .
then <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and got a <unk> that was going to america .
this has a myth that has a myth , which has a great <unk> nation again again , which was a little bit of <unk> , which is <unk> and <unk> to be <unk> .
it turned out there in new york with <unk> .
and the whole german nation 's nation is <unk> , we 're again .
that 's in all the <unk> , and that 's really what explains a little bit of this myth of this device .
but actually , in fact , <unk> , <unk> , six , seven , seven <unk> ever were built at all , and actually only two really big , <unk> that feeds the passengers .
passengers , a hundred , a hundred , where <unk> passengers and <unk> were the end of <unk> .
but it was a myth .
and then , the <unk> then was the first live <unk> accident .
next to the titanic , the titanic , where one icon , a icon , a product is <unk> , and then no longer it is .
the other vehicles were hired .
and <unk> , <unk> <unk> the last other other <unk> .
these materials used to be used for <unk> , <unk> , who velocity .
it was nothing about <unk> years .
and then they had the <unk> <unk> and zeppelin , which had the idea , maybe you should start again .
and i was recruited , because i was <unk> , because you 've developed a great product , we 're going to be right now , but the market .
yes , is it a market ?
so what 's going on ?
so .
this is what we 're talking about .
the <unk> zeppelin , which may be even more quickly to talk about , and again , again , there 's still a lot of time .
there are many companies that came out of this <unk> .
this is <unk> employees , about 20 billion revenue .
this is a right economy , the profitable word .
there 's a lot of behind .
and then i 've convinced me to get here .
now , the zeppelin , in fact , is actually a very normal airplane , as any other airplane , but has sorry , has a gas , helium , and <unk> a <unk> with <unk> .
it 's like a whale , which is in the water , and there 's a whale , and there needs to be <unk> .
now the time is not there to explain that in detail .
in the inside , it looks like a structure with a structure .
there are two types of <unk> .
there 's rigid <unk> , which is us , <unk> in the case and <unk> .
they do n't have a structure inside , and these are sort of like balloons in <unk> .
this is most of the <unk> that have been built in the world in the world , about four , <unk> piece .
and that 's just as i said , as i said , as i said , i said , i said earlier , that 's just <unk> of our own election , so only about twenty .
this is what the production looks like , if a piece of brain is speeding up .
and then the structure is again .
and the shell is also <unk> .
come from the <unk> .
origin : the <unk> of the astronauts .
so , <unk> is the roots that are origins .
cost one point one point about two million dollars so a skin .
and it 's got to be <unk> , and you have to be <unk> and have to be <unk> , because again , again , you have to look at it , again , if you have a moment inside or a hole that it can not continue .
and so , there 's a little bit of <unk> <unk> , and look at that is going to control it .
and at the end , a <unk> , no , no food without the grow .
so the zeppelin is technically a <unk> product .
and you see that , you see the numbers , quite quickly .
and one point , nine percent , one point of nine percent , one point of <unk> four percent of <unk> , which is about a thousand thousand flights in the year , maybe fall from .
it 's very very very much , very good .
this is a <unk> .
it can see that .
but there 's another trend that makes us care , and that 's what i 've got here .
we had 50 years ago , and we had about three years ago , when i started out five years ago , eight years ago , five years ago , <unk> percent <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and this year in may be <unk> .
if you go to the eight years , my eight years , in translation , <unk> <unk> and <unk> out of that , you can say , at least in this eight years , of course , a <unk> of <unk> , also , in this eight years , the weather has changed for us .
we 're <unk> .
we can not fly through fog .
you want to see something .
and the <unk> or <unk> are actually going to go every year .
so a little imagination that our weather did n't feel , but also statistically , because we 're doing weather every day .
but because that 's now , that 's good , the european union is doing a program for <unk> <unk> , and we 're an essential part of this program .
i 'm going to come from finland .
the <unk> is <unk> , is a flying laboratory .
the <unk> is the campaign .
and we 're doing <unk> in the <unk> between the surface of the earth 's surface and <unk> feet .
it 's called <unk> <unk> .
and the zeppelin t flies from italy to <unk> back to finland in a <unk> .
over many many many many hundred years of <unk> , of the air , and analyzed the air like that , how they react to our things we do at the ground .
so i 'm just saying , so i 'm just saying , there 's the second <unk> .
a great assignment for a great assignment .
and it 's like , if you want to do some <unk> from weather .
so this goes very well .
and here 's a couple of <unk> .
and the <unk> over sweden is last week or a <unk> week .
and in finland , in finland , the weather is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> degrees , <unk> degrees .
the <unk> tell you something that they had never had .
i just have a wonderful , beautiful warm days .
the mosquitos are not so bad .
we were also in africa .
and have been looking for de <unk> as a <unk> diamond , better looking at volcanoes that are <unk> , who are emptied by <unk> through millions of years .
now , you can also be asking yourself , that 's all of africa , that 's a little bit like asking for sense , asking attention to sense , asking attention to sense , it 's a way to sense that the film was <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
i mean , so what do we do here ?
and what do we need to do ?
so at the end , we went to two years .
the <unk> goes not further .
all the <unk> came back to the time , and the project was finished .
and a tornado tornado has the zeppelin back to the mast at the time that it could also stay down .
it was n't that bad .
we had a good insurance , and we were actually quite happy .
that was the prototype .
and i did n't know what to do with it .
yes , what we 're doing today , a very short game from the <unk> .
so what we do today is about complexity , this is about questions , growth or government .
what we 're doing today is the <unk> here in <unk> .
we are of course .
we have to get the zeppelin .
<unk> is <unk> .
there 's also always been devices in , after 10 , 15 years ago that need to be replaced .
we 're going to replace all the entire footprint for almost five million dollars .
there are the customers that we 're talking about .
we 're going to do it all the time .
we 're <unk> <unk> <unk> , which will control from the german <unk> and control of the european oversight , all the time , with questions like <unk> , or how <unk> .
it 's also money , and it costs money , and it 's still getting to be able to receive .
the question is : do you do it ?
do you want to develop on ?
make larger <unk> ?
there 's <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
so what do you do ?
do you go to the market ?
are you going to go on ?
and that 's what we 've tried in my time .
and in fact , we have also suffered some <unk> .
by the way , in fact , the <unk> zeppelin has been broke and broke the <unk> .
at the beginning , the donation of <unk> .
the population of the german population has saved him at six million <unk> than a fourth <unk> , and he basically was broke , the population was made a donation .
and it 's actually happened at all the <unk> zeppelin and the other companies , if we were <unk> , or i 'm not going to be here anyway .
we were in tokyo , <unk> .
we were , and you hear the past , in san francisco with a client .
this was a very <unk> device .
and both projects are sorry .
so , <unk> .
simultaneously , we won <unk> .
and i did n't have a picture of this because we ca n't show the <unk> .
but in america , in america , is now the <unk> of the first <unk> .
we sold three piece .
using <unk> , we 're going to create a partner with technology .
and this is a great success , but at the same time , it 's coming .
two customers are basically <unk> because it was n't .
why did n't it be ?
we actually know it .
or either the location was not the right or the passengers needed to know , or in america , you know , you know , you know , <unk> the last 30 years of years .
the ham people have <unk> , have seen the <unk> , have said , `` <unk> , again , a <unk> , <unk> .
so , there 's no idea that you can be able to put there .
and it was actually twice the marketing in marketing to get the over , hey , people call it .
<unk> runs good .
the pilots transport the year , transport investment , <unk> passengers .
but last year , we have only been able to get <unk> because of weather .
there 's a half a half a million .
that 's bad .
the zeppelin flies <unk> routes .
it 's the sense of that , of course , when i see the passengers as a ceo , and , and we all ca n't do it , because it 's all about <unk> , and we do n't recommend
and we 're fantastic .
and i 've got to open back to the mistake that we think we are <unk> .
you can still do more flights .
we have a <unk> <unk> , and we 're <unk> .
it 's actually not true .
we also do advertising .
this is a project that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and <unk> <unk> this with the island of <unk> .
but the <unk> is a harder market .
and you sometimes have to ask yourself the <unk> : making advertising sense ?
we actually have enough of advertising , but the internet has much changes , which is a lot of things to start looking at the horses , because the <unk> is to control everything .
the <unk> is largely <unk> , so there 's just 10 active <unk> in the world .
we have three here .
two active , one , the <unk> , three has bought <unk> , 10 .
so six .
that means that we 're going to be actually going to control the market if it 's one .
and hope to be able to derive a future again .
and the conclusion of david scott , commander of the apollo six , after his <unk> paris and five , he said , `` <unk> the walk on the <unk> . ''
so <unk> is beautiful .
i think that is yours too .
it 's just no customers .
<unk> to make a technological value , has a technological value .
there we have customers .
that 's not going to be .
it 's <unk> , goes on and down .
this is a <unk> that takes years to get the one .
and then there 's no one .
there 's also weird effect that are easy to control and hard to control .
anyway , this is the situation , <unk> , a point in the global world , so actually no market .
yet , we do further .
it 's a icon of region .
the <unk> have the strength to do it .
now , you just put the question , in what shape do we do it ?
how much money are we going to be in the global world ?
what do we do for here ?
what is the way that is supposed to be done ?
and i personally asked me to say something about something to say , of course , i 'm part of my father , of course , where i wanted to go to the <unk> , where i wanted to talk to the great <unk> , and that 's what i want to do , again , that little <unk> is going to be dead .
i used to be in a greenpeace for greenpeace , when i was in vancouver island , and i saw these entire <unk> , and this <unk> that i 'm going to do that .
and then , of course , there was a <unk> of greenpeace that were <unk> in the money , and they did n't know what they should do with it , and they 've almost been
and then they announced me to do this .
and i was introduced greenpeace for three years , and now i 'm doing this in hope to achieve a long future in the zeppelin .
zero , that 's true ? for <unk> , i 'm sick anyway . thank you .
<unk> .
yes , thank you very much .
these are my three points that i want to talk to the <unk> minutes .
why are we today in the abundance of the abundance ?
how do we get to the <unk> ?
and of all , what do you do ?
so what 's the point of it ?
so let 's start with our first point .
the first part is maybe a little <unk> .
but it 's also about to show the challenges .
a couple of years ago , to tell you a little harder to explain that .
we have a problem today , every child .
we have problems .
but it 's even worth asking to the <unk> , which is the challenges that growth growth for example .
all sorts of <unk> are exponentially .
if you see it in an historic long term , the oil oil is going to the oil oil , which will be a very short episode in history .
now , in the moment , we ca n't imagine that it 's kind of different than that oil goes down again .
you know climate change , the last <unk> years .
some say , well , we used to be <unk> , look at the last <unk> years .
you can also look at this , you know , i can look at you .
you can say , who needs the glaciers ?
you can also say the sea is far far away .
but it 's already going to be engaged with a little bit more specifically , really important challenges , about things that are really true , we just have trouble in the health issues .
<unk> is about 30 degrees .
and there 's a degrees of <unk> in our cities like in vienna , or , in vienna , are always getting bad .
it 's also about the <unk> , especially in asia .
think of the himalayas where the large streams <unk> and the <unk> of that will be <unk> water from the himalayas .
it 's not all about the planet .
the planet is the <unk> what we do , there was a lot larger crises .
and <unk> , but it 's about the human beings , which are kind of going to be very lucky .
it 's about loss in biodiversity .
the deserts .
the freshwater will always be less .
this is the aral sea where an essential part of our cotton coming from .
and all that , where does this come from ?
all these terrible things , i 'm going to tell you , with the global form of global education .
with what we get from the world out of the planet .
not only that oil and the metals and the minerals , but the minerals , but also the renewable resources are renewable , but the last thing .
and we 're supposed to look at that we use it as little as possible as it can be able to produce more waste and produce emissions .
so , it 's about saying , in the <unk> , really dramatic , really dramatic .
this is the challenge , not just climate , not just c , has two , <unk> from a car on a different way .
the way of economies .
the technology is completely new .
now , if you look at a little bit of <unk> and <unk> , and there are still on earth , and there are still on the ground societies that live so life , with a ton of cotton per year and year .
in a <unk> , it was it in the longest time of human history , three to five tons of human history .
today , it 's 15 to <unk> .
so , <unk> has this <unk> .
and it 's very , very <unk> distributed on earth .
it 's more than over north america , more than the earth is unsustainable .
and in other parts of the world , look at africa very , much less .
and what 's happening is , we can make the effects of the impact that rivers , the air , the air has become much better in the last decades , but it 's basically basically the way that we 've shifted that in other parts of the world .
and the other parts of the world can make it less .
and therefore the conflicts that we see from <unk> , is afghanistan , where they look at them on the <unk> of the american <unk> survey , and then you see where the resources come from .
and this is particularly colorful , which means , there 's a lot of materials there , where the <unk> are the world 's <unk> .
so if we want to clean up with this , then we have to set up with the topic .
so we need to change that the ecological borders are all around , the problem is everywhere .
and what we have here is , what we 're doing is not <unk> .
this has already been known for mahatma gandhi when he said , `` i 'm not asking for everybody 's need . ''
and there we are , as we live in the average average , here 's a lot more .
so .
that was the kind of <unk> part .
but i always think that you need to understand what 's worth changing .
even if i would say , i would say it 's a way to live different , which is more <unk> .
but it 's like , again , from <unk> , you need a rationale , say , `` well . ''
so what 's actually a <unk> ?
and we have to see that we 're in our rich parts of the world that we have in our rich is economically , social quality of life , in standard of living , in standard of life , in standard of life often often often do .
so here 's a pretty good mood , but there are people , and you 're definitely familiar with people who can not deal with this story with this story .
i wrote there .
<unk> and climate change have the same cause .
we work too much and too much .
that 's on one side , and that 's where we get in stressed , and eventually it 's too much .
i 'd like to work very much .
and on the other hand , we can cause these <unk> .
what 's a good life ?
how can we define that ?
now , i 'm going to get a little scientific problem .
also , what i 've said before , and what i 'm going to say is , i 'm going to say , i 'm going to say , i 'm going to say , i 'm going to say , i 'm going to say , i 'm going to say , i 'm going to say , i 'm going to say , i 'm going to say , i 'm going to say , i 'm going to say , i 'm going to say , i 'm going to say , i 'm going to say , i 'm going to say , i 'm going to say , i 'm going to say , i 'm going to think about that , but here is what 's going on , how can i define that in a way ?
and there 's important to understand life has always been two aspects .
life has the objective of the objective conditions like me , what i have to eat .
i put a roof across the head ?
have i friends ?
have i relationship , i can participate in life ?
but also , how do you do that , how do i go on this ?
i mean , i mean , i mean , that 's sometimes the perceived quality of life .
and then i 'm going to show you two terms that are important in the position .
this is needs .
the needs is the whole fundamental dimension of our human development , our <unk> is all about that .
if we can satisfy our needs , we 're happy .
and you ca n't tell you , needs are sustainable or not sustainable .
needs to be <unk> , not to the <unk> .
what are needs ?
and you can quote , i can quote different scientists , i just saw two .
and there you see , of course , the physical needs , but also need to be need for social relationships .
after protection , after <unk> , after creativity , after spirituality , to freedom .
it all has a little bit with money .
but to a big part , but the question is , how can i set this in my life .
and i 'm in the second important term .
the strategies .
the strategy i have to use to me is to fulfill that needs .
and then i 'm going to do that , i can do that with a high <unk> or with a low <unk> .
there 's a lot of money , you need to need a lot or a little money .
so strategies are just my behavior how i need my needs .
that has to do with my values , with the resources that i have .
if i do a lot of money , i try to try to satisfy my needs , when i have a lot of money on the account .
it 's all about the <unk> , which is the roof about head , to eat , and then in a way to eat the <unk> .
and here 's what it 's going to be , with much , with a lot or little things that can be sustainable or <unk> .
and if we have all the strategies that are available to satisfy my needs , then we talk about a lifestyle .
so .
that was the sort of scientific <unk> .
and now , what can we do about this ?
how do it go ?
and just just a few clues .
of course , you have to find every one of themselves .
but the evidence is to create a technical way , here is that i 've been talking about technology , and in the end of an political way .
what can we do ?
what can we do ?
what do we do ?
so where do we want to go ?
now , the slides at the start , in the beginning , the danger is that we are going to increase more resources .
for all the quality of quality , the quality of quality , and the effects are getting worse , and the effects are going to be worse , and then on the end of the end .
or , if we can make it , in a different direction , to be in a different direction that are less <unk> , maybe there are less growth with a more powerful quality of quality .
there 's one of my favorite favorite , maybe some of the <unk> of <unk> of <unk> of <unk> that 's <unk> , so more quality of life with less <unk> .
so , there 's a lot of technology that 's going to be a little bit of technology that we can use with the computer , the orange juice , the coffee , the coffee , the coffee , how can i produce that ?
but cement i can produce a different way , i can build the house of wood , etc. , etc .
to produce much less than much less or the same quality of life .
and my other teacher , <unk> <unk> has been expressed that , <unk> <unk> per <unk> , and that 's what we 've been talking about today is that we 've been talking about .
where are the needs ?
so what services can i actually satisfy ?
and how can i do this with a little bit of <unk> ?
and not with a little less but less , <unk> , <unk> percent less .
there 's many examples that you can do that .
in vienna , to build a tower with 20 <unk> .
with seven <unk> , it 's been built in <unk> .
this is essentially the principle of wood .
you know , if you do n't need to take it over years of years , and then you can take it back into his parts , and it 's not like that , so much less resources with all of the other things , you 're going to be in the fifth of the <unk> , about the entire life of the house that
but it 's also going to be a lot of our own , like , how do i do this ?
<unk> <unk> has written a beautiful book , <unk> .
where he shows , how hard it 's actually really really in the end of this is really really made from the treadmill of this treadmill .
the <unk> , i want to leave me to <unk> the other , and then i 'm like forever in this race .
you have a little like , you know , you know , you know , i have a <unk> , which i 've been happy , and then i pick up the new way .
i mean , most beautiful <unk> , i said , `` you know , you all know .
so when i started my institute , a few years ago , we 've got some letters .
then you can wait for you to go back to the letter now , you know , the letter is now writing a letter .
this is how i write hundreds of emails .
and i can afford a lot more .
this is productivity , that 's economic growth , we 're coming back to it .
but i did n't really have saved the time .
i 've been doing it for me .
but there 's good examples , slow food for example , where i really , really , really like the quality of quality , and the claim of the <unk> .
and with a low quality of quality of life .
one of my favorite examples is <unk> .
there 's a <unk> today that you 've been wondering that the average person in germany , the average person in germany , has about tens of thousands of things in the household .
can you start to count .
now , who had two , three generations of <unk> , had employees .
they have the managed .
we need to deal with them .
and increasingly less people get here , with these options .
and you need a <unk> that allows us to talk about these few things .
now , from that point of view , i 'm going to be able to do even <unk> application from the spaceship , which i 'm going to do , i do n't have thousands of things .
the next example is use instead .
it 's a real boom .
so star , <unk> , <unk> , may be developed in alternative years ago .
in the meantime , it 's always more people when you think about <unk> .
you think about <unk> .
platforms , business models that are just working with the way that we have been doing this beautiful <unk> here , which is still using a few hundred years ago , which is still using a few hundred years ago , and i 'm going to take over another centuries .
that 's what 's going to be able to use to be better .
that 's a question of justice .
i 've seen you before , like , <unk> , this is take that as a picture between africa and europe and a real world .
so if all of these resources can be able to get these resources with these resources , it 's only possible when we use less .
and that does n't mean much less quality of life because many of us have been a lot of things like that .
but it 's an important problem of economics , the company , these products , these services really provide to provide a good life with much less resources .
last key , that has to do something with the great politics , which is to do with the growth of growth , <unk> .
now , if you read a little bit of the forecasts , you see , there 's a little bit of oecd , you know , <unk> , now , the <unk> of the world , every week , these projections are going to down again .
it means , yes , a crisis is in front of the door , and the door after my view , and after what we 've been talking about , and after , what we 've been talking about economists , and we have a lot of economists , here is the numbers for austria , and you can find that
and there 's no reason to have growth , like i know that from my adolescence , from the <unk> .
for part , this has just mathematical reasons .
one point five percent growth is as much as eight percent growth .
and the eight percent is what china has today .
they may be about where we may have been born .
now , in all , if the pie is bigger , of course , is harder even more than eight percent .
one percent is still much , so we 're going to get fine .
but you 'd like to hire on , you know , that means , no self if we have zero percent growth , that means that the next year , that 's exactly so much , and consuming and incomes like this year .
we can invest well , and we can work with that .
it 's not so wrong , because you know these statistics that have been on the quality of life .
but the economy grows , but the quality of quality of life remains in a developed world , is about the state that we are .
and by the way , also jobs are also possible to growth , and that does n't happen to growth , and that does n't really matter as much as that all of us are all about .
it 's just not true , and then you have to be in the economy of economics .
and it 's still coming again , and again , as a result of <unk> like the form or a next week , which i 'm going to do , in the trend , a larger story with this topic .
already , edward <unk> , who was <unk> by saying that he was saying that he said that he was saying , the good lives of the good economy , the good economy of <unk> the good life .
this is the last end of the end of not primarily not primarily to create mental returns , not primarily to create growth for our countries .
and you have the gun , and these are places for china , for india , for india , this is the <unk> story .
and that 's actually going to be in the <unk> , if we 're still growing there , and we just can just do on this level , in this high level that we 're good on life and economies .
it 's also all about politics .
it needs goals .
it needs indicators , say the economists .
it does n't need to look like that , but we should really look at it and measure and questions that 's actually really the quality of quality ?
is that down ?
we also measure our politicians .
of course , what is the pop-up menu ?
how do it go together ?
we need a fundamental aspect of that is to put the <unk> up , and not the work .
you know , who are particularly the entrepreneurs in them , but also the employees , you know , very good .
so , what 's going on to taxes , we 've paid a colleague at all .
you could do it differently .
the resources are kind of reduces , and that 's why the resources are <unk> and not the work .
and you have to change all of all the <unk> to create jobs , to ensure of resources , health , infrastructure without growth .
it 's going to be a little bit hard .
that means that the conclusion , more or less , on all of the levels can be working in this direction , we can make a lot of things , we can be able to use the right products , services as consumer , how do we ask what we need to do , how do we need well
what do we need and what we need to do ?
the right politics elect that we 've done .
so , a few clues i gave .
and at the end of the end , of course , economic percent of all the problem is still still in the direction , how do we stimulate growth ?
but i mean , however , no way .
if you look at the forecasts , if you look at the last six years , and it goes down because it 's not going to go down because it 's not .
the politics is not creating growth , but that 's the question how do we deal with that , and that we have a good life of it ?
so , <unk> 's do it .
you 're going to be the same you <unk> in the ground .
with the heart , brain , hand , and last end , we 're going to need to do that .
thank you very much .
i 'm a <unk> <unk> .
and i love this city .
this city has so many stories .
one of this has happened a few hundred years ago .
and it 's got to do with creative problem .
i 'm going to get in this creative problem , and then something later later .
you 're going to do with the fortress .
this is <unk> <unk> that says here in the middle of the middle of this city , and a lot of this city is also changing .
another story before .
it was a hot summer day in <unk> , nevada .
a man realized , like , in its shoes , it 's really <unk> .
it 's been warm to him .
he 's europeans , he does n't know that with the heat .
he 's going to pull it down , and he does n't move a knife , and there 's several times more than many holes .
he pulls the shoe again , and it 's got a new climate .
it 's the shoe , the breathing .
and this number , which you see here is where you see here is where you see here in the origin of the table , you know , there 's a position to the bottom of the table on the mario table .
a company is born , with four characters .
it 's one or some of you know it .
he even offered the original idea .
both of them have been rejected .
so he says , well , <unk> , i 'm going to do my own company .
<unk> is going to the exchange .
today 's number today , many thousand employees in the <unk> of <unk> businesses in the world of <unk> world .
so much to work with a creative problem .
why not new , what is not there ?
and answer may be asking the question to be <unk> .
if you ca n't know , it 's an opportunity for what 's an opportunity ?
this question that has been helped me to often do in many times situations .
i mean , if it 's gone wrong , or my <unk> , i do n't work , or technology does n't work or whatever .
<unk> , little memory , <unk> .
what 's the opportunity ?
and you go from the <unk> .
what the difference is , i can illustrate with this example .
and another example was gathered by the <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> statements of <unk> .
and the evidence is how creative people can be when it comes to your own insurance .
i want to show you some examples here .
so these are actually just <unk> at the <unk> <unk> , and that 's also made it a <unk> .
i 'm going to be fantastic .
my son did n't have a <unk> .
it 's just <unk> , which is the woman through the <unk> .
or i had all the day plants every day , when i reached the intersection , all of the <unk> , and i could n't see the other car .
clearly , who 's going to be , right ?
the bush .
the <unk> are <unk> .
i 've been <unk> and two .
so , you know , at least , you can pay at least half a <unk> <unk> .
the last one i was not kidding .
blame was the young woman in the <unk> .
if you are a man , any more explanation is obsolete .
but if you are a woman , you do n't understand it anyway .
so human beings are creative , we are creative .
and i want me to join me and i dream that we can use all more of these creativity .
many of us are in a <unk> <unk> .
and that does n't have to be that way .
why not do things differently ?
now , old things that we 've been going to do , we have been going to be <unk> that may seem to be <unk> or <unk> .
why not just make it different , the <unk> , as little simple <unk> .
and there 's so <unk> companies that are using that .
for example , <unk> , who are these <unk> of their <unk> , and you have these signs on the wall , for example , and there may be what it is .
a way , right ?
so , i want to stay in coffee instead of the coffee .
or so what .
we do n't have a <unk> , <unk> you .
now , you know , is it <unk> , right ?
if you ca n't show the cell phone .
or if you eat me , if we were starving .
rude , but creative .
it needs something .
i 'm talking about one of the customers or the people who would be <unk> and say , ok , that would like me .
this is what i call .
a <unk> <unk> has <unk> the current <unk> , and in <unk> .
once the sport 's news , again , of politics .
if you were three times there , you 're <unk> .
once the complaint went to a long time for food .
it 's a <unk> building , and the restaurant is very small , so the chefs got to do all your hands .
it was deeply deeply .
so they have thought , together , what do we do ?
how do we solve the problem ?
we can not get faster in the kitchen .
this idea is created .
on every table , a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> salt , pepper and <unk> .
so that the <unk> people in the wait are eating their <unk> on the wait .
just different .
so , a creative idea , and maybe we have solved the <unk> .
there is a person that is not very popular right now .
this person is the leader of <unk> , so the <unk> of the <unk> .
and now , there 's the <unk> .
and the second day , that 's just monday , so four days .
a company chose <unk> <unk> to employees , and you may be elected .
a <unk> says , `` wow , '' we thank you .
human beings come to us to be <unk> .
the buses are full , it 's going to be <unk> , people start organizing , because everybody else is looking for , of course , for a to b .
but why not even use some current and creative from his disadvantage ?
sometimes i think creativity is also happening .
and it comes out of a <unk> maybe like this company you may recognize .
so , we know yes , we do n't really know that in the <unk> do n't really go well , but they have to save a little harder .
or at the car .
you know , you know the different , <unk> , and all sorts of directions .
yes .
why not one piece of geese are going to the car when you go to the car ?
or in <unk> , there are possibilities of being creative .
and all that has to do with humor , with humor , with happiness , sometimes it 's stupid , <unk> ?
sometimes it 's funny .
once my favorite son was in my office .
and i 'm sitting on this slide .
so we have several <unk> around the <unk> .
and then he turns from the left to the right , he 's saying , `` hey , '' and i say in my <unk> <unk> , `` you '' you 're sorry . ''
he 's looking at me , looking at me , big eyes , playground .
and in the moment , i actually have <unk> .
why is n't the playground ?
why is what we do , not the playground for adults ?
so , that 's a lot more powerful , right ?
if we are relaxed , if we 're using our talent , what we like to do .
and it 's going to make it <unk> , but it 's a simpler way .
the curious thing is that if a day comes from the week , what about our brain .
it 's the first day in the week , and somehow our focus on another day .
that 's how another day we 'd rather do .
this is how weekends .
you know , you can hear that in the media .
so on the <unk> , yes , just a day to the weekends .
or if you see the most beautiful time of the year , the holiday will be announced .
what are the rest of the <unk> weeks of the year ?
is it so terrible ?
are we all working jobs ?
and one of them have been a <unk> , there was one of the evidence .
yes , monday , i can say , `` the rest you live in . ''
or on <unk> , on facebook , on facebook , all over the social networks are picked up .
once i 'm going to <unk> through the <unk> , one of the <unk> in <unk> .
there 's a lot of businesses , and i like to look at me .
what 's in the <unk> , what is that ?
and one day , i 'd like to buy this business with these signs .
and the first sign that you see here , yes , that 's actually quite nice .
so , with love , instead of working .
i mean , i 'm going to do that , my father 's father 's father , but i also love my work .
yes .
or still <unk> for <unk> is the <unk> sign .
why the own view of doing it , and it becomes more important , and more and more and more .
somebody else has an answer to this direction , if it 's not the monday , it 's your jobs .
and i 'm actually going to do with the pink pair of glasses , here go ahead and say , okay .
what about my job ?
stupid , it 's also the pink pair of glasses , it looks the same as before .
so , something beautiful that is not beautiful , does n't work .
the pink glasses , by the way , is really great to the bicycle .
you know , you 're going to fly a little bit of the fly that you would get in the eye .
but they do n't want to <unk> them .
so where do we change that , if we do n't change that ?
actually , the job , the content , our <unk> ?
within the company , outside of them .
it may end in a system where we feel like the mouse .
and the mouse goes up in this wheel , and it 's walking , and eventually it 's going to go quickly , and at some point it 's going to go quickly , it 's going to go quickly , this wheel gets the poor mouse and you get out .
but what does the mouse do ?
now , you do n't know anything else , you 're back in the <unk> .
and again , again , maybe the film <unk> a day , you know , you know , maybe wait a minute , you may be soft .
so this is beautiful <unk> here with hay , so it 's going to be there , and it goes and again .
and that , what we feel as a funny feel , the mouse has been concussion , yes ?
or something needs is that <unk> <unk> .
i went back to a lot of years ago when i went home from a seminar .
and on once , the street , it felt like , it was very black before my eyes , and somehow i have to stay .
the next day , i went to the doctor , because i was thinking , what 's going on ?
he was looking at me and said , `` no , '' is physically everything .
but what about the pop-up menu ?
and i looked into my calendar , and i looked at this , and saw , i was working three weeks through , and i kind of put my job .
after 20 years of <unk> and participants who have been asking if we can do the first thing that we can do at night .
i thought , well , what else is it else ?
and i started to put other priorities , to put other priorities , to see that i 'm going to go with my family <unk> , something good for me .
<unk> , if it 's not <unk> , there 's no way of other <unk> in my job , a new prediction .
i realized , the talks about big groups that make me really joy .
i 'm going to do , like counseling and <unk> , and other things , but these talks to each other , i 'm going to be able to talk to you .
and that was n't always the way .
i 've got to recognize that this <unk> stress is sick .
and sometimes it takes me to be <unk> at front of the front of the front , <unk> from me to be <unk> from the hospital after he had a heart attack , and he 's starting to be <unk> .
i used to say , when i said , you 're going to leave me on , he always go to me , yes , you 're walking with your walk and so .
this is what he goes .
so , with <unk> , it 's a slow way , it 's slowly , in the right stage , but sometime we 'll be going to go together .
what happens ?
in the end , we 're going to be healthier .
the <unk> go down , but a curved line that spreads is the diseases of mental health .
now , <unk> minus four percent over the last 10 years , <unk> nearly 86 percent , which is beautiful , that will be less .
increase the mental illness plus <unk> percent .
that 's something i think is to be that ?
why is that ?
is that just in austria ?
no , too .
<unk> , <unk> , that will be healthier .
this is so here on the left .
on the bottom of psychiatric disorders , a hundred percent of the last 10 years , a great german <unk> .
the number of <unk> <unk> takes them .
the cost is .
and there 's all sorts of official , what can we do with this topic ?
now , you have to be able to think of that , and you 're going to start looking at this , like , <unk> , like this .
so it 's good .
and somebody once said , no alcohol is not a solution .
but what 's the solution ?
so what 's the way that we make ourselves healthy again and make a joy ?
and that has been engaged in the last years .
i think , is there 's something like <unk> , can there be something like this ?
i 'm a <unk> , the job is not the idea of what makes us complete and happy .
there are many other things that are important , family , health , and so on .
but the fact is that we spend the biggest part of our <unk> in work .
and if we do that , we do n't think it 's so doing that that makes us joy and the other way to do it .
the <unk> <unk> i 'm going to do is to talk to you as last another , and for <unk> .
these little <unk> that will be easier to see .
so <unk> relates for talent , freedom and environment .
that means how do i mean , `` am i my talents ? ''
in what environment do i do .
what is the freedom of doing what i want to do ?
because is the level of <unk> that <unk> us .
the more of them , the more stress .
and what do i do ?
that 's how the treatment .
these four areas are these four areas .
and it can look at each other .
i had to look at this , and i 've got to look at a couple of years ago , and i always do it again .
can i do my talent ?
what environment ?
and that means , sometimes i go to a cafe with my laptop to prepare the seminar .
the freedom .
so , the freedom can take me to do that .
and do i do it ?
that 's how the treatment .
the last u u .
and then there 's again people who tell me why that is not going to be .
and why that is much more difficult .
i 'd like to have a response to this place .
who wants to find ways .
who do n't have reasons .
and by the way , by the way , you can say , `` do i think of what i 'm going to do , do i think way , do i call ways ? ''
and you 're going to have you right now .
so what do we do with our talent ?
every one of you saw his great <unk> .
it 's a lot too small .
it 's filled with talent , with gold , with all kinds of things .
so what do we do ?
so by the way , by the way , we 're asking that .
or if we 're in the hospital , or at the end of a life .
what did i do with my talent ?
and by the way , who did here , <unk> , can be able to access here .
so what we do with our talent , is so my first question , again , on me , and that 's every day .
am i doing the good enough ?
and the resources .
there 's another story .
i wanted to tell you about <unk> .
and that 's what i 'm going to do .
and this fortress was salvation for the <unk> than <unk> years ago .
and the enemies realized that this fortress was built so well that you could n't take them .
thick walls , steep ways , the <unk> to fortress , thick doors , <unk> <unk> .
it was <unk> .
so this is what this is , okay , if we do n't come in , we train a <unk> .
we do n't get out there .
he 's looking at how long it did .
the <unk> thought it was coming up to the day , where the <unk> were almost used .
they 've just had a <unk> who was already on the way to get rid of an <unk> , and the <unk> says , to the bishop , <unk> give me three days .
and then , <unk> , <unk> , you 've been working . i 'm going to leave you , come on , take a <unk> and help us .
<unk> goes to the <unk> way .
on the bottom of the enemies at the bottom , the wall of the fortress is going to get a <unk> , which is going to go back to the right and the early .
well , think about , a <unk> , what is that .
it 's morning .
again , a <unk> <unk> , the wall of the fortress , this is black .
enemies think , oh , who 's still two <unk> , can it take .
now , the same thing is , again , this is the <unk> that 's going to be on .
in the end of the second day , after the six different types of <unk> saw them look at the bottom , they were moving into a <unk> .
because they thought that 's going to be a long , we do n't think of that .
after then , the <unk> went down to the <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
you 've got the one that they had and they were <unk> .
this is the <unk> <unk> .
i like this idea that it 's all there is what we need , and we have everything .
sometimes it 's <unk> resources , sometimes it 's not a lot , sometimes it 's little .
but we can also do something with that .
we have no idea of the power we have to invent the world every day .
and if you think that could now be a good <unk> .
the spring is the spring .
that 's coming .
and we know , in <unk> , the snow disappears there is going to get there , and then the plants are going to catch plants from <unk> brown <unk> .
it 's where blooms are coming from these blooms of blooms .
and there 's a very popular that we can harvest and eat .
there are grain in the grain of this grain then we can grow around and baking bread .
there are any animals that eat that .
there are people who are going to eat the products that they can eat .
and it 's automatically automatically .
but if you think about that , maybe it 's not not like that , it 's going to be a fear and failure .
and of course , this threat is just very abstract , but also , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very well , in the realm of blooms , the disconnect of the flower to the plants , bees
there are the research that shows that to <unk> percent of our food , in particular food , if we had no bees .
well , it sounds like that , because it 's so normal for us , and we may not perceive bees as well .
now , there was a very interesting movie now , a very interesting movie , <unk> , to the topic .
and i recommend , look at you .
but now let 's look at the lord , which is now with bees with bees , which is in a while , in <unk> , in <unk> , the importance of bees .
and this is what he 's doing here at <unk> , and he 's going to tell us a lot about his work .
please , mr. <unk> .
yes , good evening .
you 've just got a big thank you . and you know , all the <unk> .
so that i 'm talking about my project , <unk> , <unk> , is something that can contribute something about the life of bees .
and there 's also under a wing of a <unk> to tell you about little things that is fun .
i want to suppose that the least more <unk> is now , it would be a <unk> company to bring them into the basics of businesses .
i do n't do that , no .
but maybe i get to try to tell you that you can start to love these <unk> , or to make a certain empathy that you 're going to develop and engage them for this <unk> , <unk> insect .
my name is thomas <unk> , i 'm <unk> and young , father of five children , father of five children and <unk> and work in <unk> and work for <unk> medical school and adults .
i 'm in a member of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
and work now in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> with our oldest students in the <unk> .
we work in the garden in agriculture and in beekeeping .
<unk> is actually a play of <unk> <unk> and <unk> from <unk> <unk> .
and our flying classrooms is more <unk> , a silence , a quiet thing .
and she also leads to the quiet .
it 's almost a <unk> matter .
and not free , the ancient greeks have been known for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and in a wonderful verse of <unk> , he 's like the <unk> <unk> to make his <unk> foot to inspire him to inspire him again .
but the <unk> do n't go down , but they send her the blue bees , and we <unk> the denser the lips with <unk> and <unk> in the mouth and out of it later the words in the mouth .
a beautiful picture .
hopefully i get the evening tonight .
yes .
the flying classrooms .
i come to the project .
one of these <unk> , these <unk> , i 'm going to put my students together with me and <unk> for <unk> to a <unk> .
in <unk> schools , in <unk> , in <unk> , or in the <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> , or in the <unk> .
a <unk> for <unk> or in classrooms in classrooms .
the teacher that accompanied this project , with me of the class , and we 're looking for a <unk> space for that .
in the window , the kids can see something like this month .
and all of all things you can see is the bees that are out there in the hose and can be <unk> again .
and then it 's going to be created a match at the window .
so .
and then the whole thing starts to me on the <unk> .
so i 'm going to take a <unk> and a result of a <unk> <unk> , and now you put it in this <unk> .
so , in this <unk> , <unk> are bees .
also , we 've got <unk> here , and here , we have to be <unk> <unk> .
and then you have a <unk> , there 's the top .
there 's the honey inside .
you need bad weather , and you can not fly .
so .
this is what that looks like .
and then the <unk> here comes back here , and immediately starts to take transport places like that , of course , <unk> places in school .
and now , something wonderful starts .
ladies and gentlemen , the bees in the class , i suddenly have a crisis .
the people are not more .
you 're lonely .
you do n't find your queen .
and that 's the most important job of the <unk> when he makes this <unk> loop that he 's going to be the queen in the old people .
so that 's not on these two <unk> .
and they 're being sad , these bees .
they start to <unk> .
yes , the <unk> says , they <unk> .
you hear that .
they 're almost less than if they were living in their <unk> with a queen .
and now , i 'm starting to get a <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , in a night , you 're now developing the need to reasons a new people , and the whole thing happens without <unk> , without conferences , without opinions and positions .
so here 's the people , and then it 's in the first night here .
because without queen , this people would not exist more for six weeks .
because <unk> life only for six weeks .
so .
and in this first night , you can get out of one of this <unk> a little bit , and you put it into these <unk> .
and then , there 's a queen <unk> .
everybody who was born in high high school said , how do you go ?
yes , genetically engineered is all genetically sophisticated .
that 's true .
and now , something wonderful starts .
and the egg here , what 's happened in the <unk> 's <unk> will be a <unk> , a queen .
and the egg has the first three days the same genetic code like the <unk> code .
and then it 's going to spend <unk> from a <unk> <unk> .
you know this term .
and immediately , on this piece of <unk> , the genetic code of the genetic code .
the <unk> are changing by the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
we 've already heard that what we eat , that 's what we 've been eating , what 's going to be that .
and the queen is really wonderful .
so three days so , five days <unk> .
and that 's what the students can handle .
you see that in class .
and then , this cell will be <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , and it 's not happening , because the people will be <unk> <unk> , or because of a <unk> says , it 's supposed to be , or you 're going to say , you know ,
no , this is what happens .
ladies and gentlemen , that 's a <unk> or a <unk> .
and then the students wait eight days every student knows , three five eight a queen makes a queen <unk> , so that this queen <unk> .
and the day , if that 's supposed to happen , the teacher has <unk> the <unk> in the <unk> , the <unk> in the students in the students .
and then the mother says , say , what 's going on with you ?
yes , i have to school .
yes , why , why ?
yes , our queen <unk> .
yes ?
and then the morning is around six in school .
and then hit their <unk> <unk> to this <unk> , because they want to <unk> , like this queen now <unk> .
and if you can really experience that , you can hear about first .
this queen <unk> .
so .
a little higher .
and then the <unk> , and cut this queen .
the first one is what this queen makes her wing , and there 's now with her <unk> of the people that the people of the people , what 's a queen , their smell , their <unk> .
and the people now have a identity .
now , three to five days long .
so , from the <unk> , you can see her <unk> .
the <unk> comes out , from the people , from this <unk> .
and after five days , this queen goes out of the <unk> .
now , some of the things now , yes , i 've been seen , i 've seen a little bit of <unk> in the <unk> .
wait , <unk> .
what 's completely different .
-- that 's what we do .
and this queen is now running up with no <unk> , without <unk> , from this <unk> , to two kilometers high .
you 've probably seen in your zeppelin .
in the <unk> , and it 's going to be a <unk> <unk> , from seven to 12 drones , the male bees .
so the other way around like islam , where the man can have different women , the queen , the seven to 12 men .
and this is what 's happening in a wonderful way .
the drone comes from the back of the back , and this queen 's going to be , and this queen , you 're going to take the same thing in this recent <unk> , which you need to pay for seeds for three years .
it 's an amazing experience .
if you 're done with the <unk> , you 're dying and fall dead from the sky .
and then the queen comes back and starts to lay eggs .
there are always a , two students in the class that immediately see that immediately .
you see the queen .
yes .
and then slowly the project in school , because now , the <unk> are <unk> again , and the queen and the <unk> will be in <unk> there .
and then i come up , i put one evening before .
<unk> the <unk> of the outside , and the next morning i <unk> this <unk> with the queen and this bees at the <unk> .
and here you see the queen .
yes .
fresh <unk> .
and it 's mostly about the way 10 to twelve <unk> .
and then these two <unk> are coming here in a <unk> .
in a full stick , in a prey , and now this people can be big and powerful .
why bees in school ?
ladies and gentlemen , the kids have experienced that , forget that .
yes .
so there 's not just that in this class , students are all the time with the bees , but the whole school is coming in this class .
and the teacher , if he can knows something if he can put something that can be prepared for a period of time to the other .
look at bees , bees and planning <unk> <unk> years ago , we have paintings cave paintings where people have told the honey .
a couple months ago , in israel , in israel , was found in israel that people have thought of the bees at the time .
we have any human culture with bees .
or the other way , the bees were in every culture .
in china , in india in <unk> , in egypt , in greece in rome in rome .
and they were everywhere .
human cultures , my ladies and gentlemen , are war .
he can join a <unk> , a <unk> , can join a <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , you know what flowers or trees do <unk> the bees , what you need ?
you know , you know , you can find something like this now in the summer of agriculture .
that 's out there , this is a green desert for our bees .
yes ?
and he can walk in the students in the <unk> , and they can see with flowers , to highlight and see how long , how long do you need from the <unk> to my flowers ?
how long are you on the individual blooms ?
and how long need you need to come back back .
he can do <unk> <unk> .
how do i get a <unk> ?
yes .
you know if it 's that that 's what 's going to be the top , flat side is flat side ?
look at it .
he can join mathematics -- a <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , he can discover the <unk> <unk> on these <unk> .
and then he comes to the question , how could karl <unk> get the nobel prize ?
because he adopted the bees in the beehive .
but , ladies and gentlemen , in a beehive is <unk> .
there 's nothing a show up there .
and just the professor <unk> , who has spent many years in <unk> in the university of the university , and found that in <unk> has found in <unk> , that the bees are going to be able to create a <unk> .
like a <unk> web out of the <unk> web on the <unk> , to create a <unk> , and now with <unk> hertz , and the bees , and the bees , the <unk> , with their legs , with their <unk> .
do you see what these bees are in school ?
it 's <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the kids are losing the fear of bees .
and develop an awareness for the bees .
you learn how to look at what the bees are doing .
and you get a warning in front of these creatures that basically lives only for us .
the bees are not going to be a kilo of a pound every year in the year .
<unk> years ago , the only way to make branches .
they collect the <unk> out of the trees .
this is a <unk> , with the <unk> .
and now imagine in the summer , these are <unk> -- <unk> bees in this tight space , at <unk> degrees .
hey , there 's no way there are <unk> .
no , at the bees .
because they 're in this <unk> of natural antibiotics .
they collect the pollen , and by making him <unk> , he 's going to be a <unk> <unk> .
somebody who 's got here in the <unk> , including <unk> , <unk> that can go to a <unk> and make a <unk> prescribe by <unk> the <unk> from the people .
and of course , there 's a grid , and with <unk> with a <unk> and so on , there 's nothing happening .
and then , and then , and gentlemen , and gentlemen , the <unk> of the <unk> do n't do this , of course , and we would have less apples , if the bees would n't fly there , or we need to go to the <unk> and
there 's a lot more .
look at the <unk> , there 's the ground out there , which is also growing up on the <unk> where the cows graze .
and then , the bee goes down , they move their nectar and <unk> that <unk> .
and now the cow comes and ate the <unk> and just because they can digest <unk> .
yes ?
and then she <unk> that back and notice , ah , yeah , i 've got <unk> <unk> , ah , i can get <unk> .
and then there 's milk .
that makes the bee .
yes ?
and at the end of the day , the bee gives us the most valuable thing that we have on the nature of nature .
the honey .
i want to come to a moment to get in a moment , <unk> .
my students look like to build these <unk> , and then partly partly to me in the schools .
now , this is not my <unk> , but i had a student in college , and i said , i said , i said , i said , i said , `` well , in college , '' you know , you put yourself <unk> .
and then he says , yes , i 'm hot .
i come from <unk> at <unk> , and i am 20 years .
and i have been in <unk> for five years of <unk> and for two years for the <unk> .
and i 'm going to talk to me that i do n't have to learn to the <unk> of learning , but learn the hands .
<unk> , yeah .
and a <unk> went through the <unk> , <unk> college .
and more than half of them said , oh yeah , we want to be .
my students are experiencing an enormous appreciation and the sites in the same , in <unk> , normal and the <unk> people can pick through the bees .
in <unk> , and they 're moving to your students , my students and some pride .
how do you get to the bee ?
the question is wrong .
you need to say , how do you go to the pop-up menu ?
and i think , there 's the person that <unk> the other people , and there 's a new <unk> .
and he says , well , let 's start with it .
at the end of a little poem , a little poem of <unk> of <unk> .
who is like the bee would feel the sun through the <unk> , the way of the flower will find the flower to the flower , and never lose the direction of <unk> the fields in <unk> glance as quickly he would also live .
thank you very much .
hi , love friends in all the world .
and so welcome to my project .
the project of my person and my wife .
it 's the battle for a end of female <unk> .
i mean , in my eyes , the biggest crime of mankind , because it has been <unk> for <unk> years .
the society against women are still having <unk> sacrifice per day .
i 've got to imagine <unk> .
my name is <unk> , i come from hamburg .
i 've been doing a series of years .
you can think of the job that my job has n't been <unk> .
i did n't feel <unk> .
and so i was happy that i was glad that i could pull around the topic of <unk> and exciting .
for example .
with a massive <unk> across the atlantic of africa .
on the sail a plea to <unk> the <unk> of brazil , the imminent genocide in the last <unk> indians prevent the <unk> .
this was a journey where i was more <unk> than <unk> , more than <unk> .
yet , this is the way that these things were to find the interest of the media , and even a little person like i could bring his care to language .
i 've been <unk> with my own <unk> .
and then there was war between <unk> and ethiopia and we got <unk> of this murders .
and despite all the cruelty we experienced , we saw the infinite hospitality of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> , arab hospitality .
and twice that we were invaded that we were invaded and our two <unk> that you see here with their bodies , with their bodies as living <unk> in front of us , and that 's my <unk> .
if you need to kill your kill .
something like that i found in any other culture .
and then , in young years , in young years , that you ca n't reduce islam in terrorism .
also christians do n't want to be reduced to their terrorism .
for example , the <unk> .
the <unk> , the <unk> .
but rather to the true values like love , social accountability .
these are the values that it 's worth caring about .
after many years , i 've been <unk> in this <unk> , with my wife .
and then we had heard of this <unk> female <unk> .
when i heard that <unk> percent of the everyday waves are <unk> the other victims , the rest of the things are christians and <unk> , '' i thought how can you think of a <unk> like islam to the <unk> of the shoes ?
and the idea was was born the highest policymakers of islam to explain the practice to sin .
and we were looking at these mindsets in german organizations that we have n't found .
so , we had to be completely <unk> now . islam is not <unk> .
you 'd <unk> the throat .
on the <unk> of <unk> international , we then created our own organization .
and they were independent and <unk> independent .
and now to get this battle now , we needed images .
it was a lack .
and so , in fact , <unk> and i moved back into this desert to take these pictures .
the terrible bloody images , which i do n't show you , but i want to suggest that quickly the crime .
girl in the age of four weeks up to wedding , from her parents and relatives , on the ground , on the ground , and they put on the limbs on the limbs , and they 're going to hide the clitoris and the <unk> <unk>
and what you 're wearing is a open step of a <unk> .
now , you want to be a <unk> .
if you get your rule , you get two weeks .
<unk> destroys body and soul , guess what they would .
this was the beginning of the so-called <unk> .
the <unk> goes on .
the man has to open them up .
he 's never seen a <unk> woman .
the <unk> told him , oh , <unk> , is no problem .
you <unk> your penis with <unk> , and then you <unk> you hard .
and if you ca n't make it , it 's not bad .
then you take the knife and <unk> them .
this is <unk> <unk> .
that 's a third of the girl .
this was a few months ago .
shock , the girl lost his language .
these are the <unk> , even some in asia .
most of them are <unk> .
and when we asked muslims , why did you do this ?
so the <unk> answer , we need to do that , that is in the koran .
nothing is in the koran .
every unit of believers , <unk> <unk> every day , like <unk> , the creator , is perfect , <unk> .
but they do n't seem to believe what you pray .
they <unk> <unk> , a <unk> to his <unk> , and why you can be <unk> as a <unk> person in women .
but now , now we had the images of the first university to this <unk> .
he <unk> us , his whole <unk> <unk> to a conference .
and there was hard discussions for two days .
but we had the minister on our side , the highest <unk> on our side .
and then the great decision , the practice is against all human rights , against religion , we 've got to <unk> him .
as the last <unk> , the way <unk> of this new <unk> .
and if you have africa , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it 's been depressed for these people .
and it has been celebrated and such successes we have in other countries .
so , for example , short example , <unk> here are <unk> in the highest spiritual , the <unk> of the country , the <unk> of the country , the <unk> of the country is to write a crime , to writing and wear it into the <unk> .
for weeks , we went on with their own <unk> .
a hundred , and we had this .
and where we came , we only have open ears , open arms , arms , holy hospitality .
and when we wanted to leave the country eventually , the great scholar and <unk> <unk> , you 'd really want to go now <unk> countries now ?
you 're not going to give you more lifetime .
he 's right .
i 'm a <unk> , and there 's been slowly going to be slowly .
and in fact , he had an idea .
he said , if there are you going to take the 10 <unk> muslims in the world to get a table , and explain the practice to the sin , it 's a sin .
<unk> , and i flew to cairo in the <unk> and -- mosque the <unk> of the <unk> .
and in the <unk> , for example , to the <unk> , his <unk> professor <unk> , we got a <unk> .
he was really excited about the idea of the idea , especially when we can make a <unk> that we could fund it .
and that 's what we 're doing with <unk> that we need to support .
and then he said , i 'm going to just <unk> the conference , as we had asked him , but i 'm going to take the <unk> .
and he did .
in cairo , in cairo , in a year , in a couple of years , to <unk> our transparent .
international <unk> went to <unk> of the <unk> of the female body .
under the <unk> of the <unk> professor <unk> <unk> .
and everybody 's got .
a hundred <unk> , but the highest world .
in the middle of qatar , the man 's <unk> has <unk> in hamburg , and in the rest of europe , he 's the worst largest thing for cartoons .
so men can decide and kill death .
but it 's also another .
on the left of the <unk> , the right , the <unk> , my <unk> .
the highest world .
i mean , i 'm just going to show you a little bit more vacuum and personal .
and then i saw them all .
it started the conference .
and among our shield , on the <unk> of the left side of egypt .
the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> egypt , <unk> from woman to <unk> mubarak and <unk> , germany .
so , for a lot of topic , islam is not <unk> .
we also had medical arguments in the way that you have a <unk> , which is a terrible women to do with the <unk> .
and then you have a video to show her film .
reality .
the men had <unk> eyes .
they went back to the <unk> doors , after only two hours , you 'd been decided to be a <unk> , a <unk> .
that 's what happens to the cameras , accused of what you 've decided .
and the most important sentence , that was this .
female <unk> is a <unk> crime of islam against islam .
he <unk> the <unk> .
we thought the job was done , but we did the bill without without our <unk> .
because the shame to talk about the abdomen of the woman is more powerful than everyone .
that 's why we have <unk> .
we 've been documenting this conference in this called golden book .
one <unk> for the <unk> of the world .
and because <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , it was so good , the book , he was blessed with a <unk> .
it 's got our hands out of the hands .
we had to do conferences in many countries , and we had to conferences conferences with the highest one .
and they were reading the interest in some were so excited that you have <unk> the book .
sadly , most of them do n't have the courage to be able to announce .
you 're not talking about the abdomen of the woman .
only some have <unk> the courage .
now , you 've gone to the universities , at least .
and sometimes we have found some of the kind of bold that actually actually found in the mosque of the mosque of it , like this .
and then , out of speakers in the <unk> list .
and that 's the subjects .
they 're going to spread it .
but i 'm going to walk the time .
it 's all <unk> of hot stones , and that 's why i work on many other strategies , this topic .
this is the practice .
but my <unk> would be this .
i want to announce the great message of the highest message of the world 's favorite <unk> to the birthplace of islam , which is here at the kaaba in mecca .
not like <unk> <unk> , but in the <unk> .
when there are four million people come together , men and women are <unk> islamic currents .
then i said , `` well , i '' and the <unk> king send my transparent up between the <unk> .
i 've been trained in the <unk> .
i 'm sorry to the last <unk> , which is the <unk> king .
but i 'm sure if he would be a <unk> .
one to help these women .
to the other , to show the world , which are the true values of islam , all of the way that we 're going to be here .
by terrorists , as a <unk> .
if i do n't do that , i may be able to do this , i may have been <unk> in hamburg .
at least , at least many <unk> in the mosques are in the mosques .
and we could put our transparent there .
and maybe i 'd like , you know , that little girl is not going to be <unk> .
then my life has been paid for it .
and i want to say , i want to be on everybody who 's now has now to be seen .
not being a <unk> .
we need to take the practice in the ton , if you do n't have any further .
and now , i want to show you the design design of my video .
this is my <unk> , my <unk> .
and this is in all the <unk> in <unk> in the morning , in the name of <unk> , and <unk> that needs to be happy .
there we have it in german .
female <unk> is incompatible with the koran and the ethic of islam .
she 's <unk> and a discrimination of islam .
thank you .
thank you .
so , i 'm going to start .
this is what the <unk> that you get as a refugee in germany .
for example , my mother , my brother and i take a package of a package .
it <unk> <unk> .
my mother was totally terrified , because they did n't understand why that 's now given us now .
the third day we have finally been trained .
and we were going to throw it back into the trash , it wanted it to throw it back into it , and it was just a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
she tried to explain to us to explain that , you can eat that .
this is not blessing .
it actually tastes very well .
it 's cheese .
my mother moved up the eyebrow and we laughed .
cheese .
but in my own country , we have <unk> , but they did n't smell that way .
i 'm <unk> <unk> and <unk> years old .
six years ago , i went to my mother and my brother from china after germany .
i 'm going to tell you about this <unk> .
but especially it 's about the people that allowed me to have these <unk> and have done a success story .
but first i 'm going to tell you where i come from .
i 'm a <unk> .
<unk> are a little <unk> that live in the northwest .
and this region is called the eastern area of <unk> .
it 's about <unk> miles from germany .
in china , in china , in china , the total of 10 million <unk> are the largest <unk> community outside china .
and these <unk> live here because we need to suffer in china in china .
hundreds of thousands of chinese have been <unk> by <unk> to our own home to a minority .
our own language of language , <unk> has been eliminated from the education system .
in schools and in universities , they will only be trained in chinese .
and our religion can not be free .
the ones , they lose their culture and identity .
and if somebody 's bold is , and for the rights of <unk> <unk> , you know , in fact , your own <unk> period , or death .
that was the reason why my parents decided to escape with children with children .
this was <unk> , and i was 11 years old .
this is a picture of our escape .
we had n't had enough money , so my father had to leave behind .
i 'm going to take a lot of people that have helped us to be the lead .
i <unk> my lot of images .
but i 'm going to be <unk> , but i 'm going to show you the <unk> of our <unk> .
i mean , i 'm going to leave it in front of me .
he was a big <unk> , <unk> , and we always met with his little <unk> in a lot .
the first rate was <unk> .
i know many of a negative picture of <unk> have been doing business to do business refugees , and not interested for the fates .
but i 'm going to say i 'm going to call it <unk> .
because <unk> has <unk> us .
he was in <unk> at the airport , in <unk> to a <unk> , and it 's got to move up to the last conclusion that we 're also coming through the <unk> .
in <unk> , we came out , and i still know , like my mother , i was going to go out of the airport out of the airport .
you do n't think about it .
until we are out .
because i had a look at my hand , and there was my photograph in my hand , but there was a stranger , <unk> .
i had to see as a <unk> .
and i 'm <unk> , i 'd like to put my look at my pass .
silence .
<unk> .
a long way .
we 've finally been <unk> .
in <unk> , i found myself in a lot of the incidents that have been very supportive of us .
i 'm going to <unk> my <unk> woman that used to us with us .
<unk> with four <unk> per <unk> 13 families .
at least <unk> .
a <unk> and a kitchen .
there were strangers faces .
and many different languages .
and we had no privacy .
my mother , my brother and i had to share a <unk> .
it was eaten , slept and homework .
and friends did n't come to visit because i used to be <unk> .
just my <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> know what i knew .
and she knew my story , and i was very , very , very , and she 'd take care of me .
for example , they brought me to <unk> <unk> what i do n't do .
but she also helped me know german <unk> .
i spent my whole adolescence in the <unk> .
that was not just my mother .
alone with us alone without the man , and always in the uncertainty of uncertainty , because we could only get a <unk> and could be <unk> .
i 'm <unk> that i was very , very , very <unk> .
it 's also a little bit embarrassing , so i 'm going to tell you now , but now i just have to stand into my story .
i was very ambitious , and i could be interested in school .
so , the first way of all of us , we got the catholic <unk> where we went to the first time with normal children .
i mean , i mean , i mean , i 'm going to be my kids who do n't have to live in a <unk> .
i also sent me to the <unk> who have me and my brother .
just to get out of it .
i also <unk> myself in a couple of <unk> <unk> that made us homework , because our parents do n't have german .
or we just did it .
we have always been very happy .
i know , as we got to the fence , and wait until these people came , because they took strangers for us , and that was important .
after two years , i finally came to germany .
but the problem was that he was directly <unk> by <unk> , because it was n't a place in <unk> .
i <unk> in the very , very engaged scientist that has been able to get my father before the <unk> to china , they actually made it that he could have been able to live in <unk> .
i 'm going to be <unk> to this time where i actually was very , very happy , because after six years , we got to move into a normal home .
we got an opportunity for three years , and we finally had a own apartment with a car and a own kitchen .
and i even had a room .
it was very small , and i had no desk in , but it was good , i could open my door .
and i 'm <unk> that i have been used to have a very good job , but i still had to leave the <unk> without hit .
i really did n't saw perspective .
and there was a <unk> that came up with me , and still , i still do i think about the idea that i can <unk> my degrees of my degrees .
so first of all , the <unk> .
and i thank you the teachers that really believed to me , and i really did n't actually have the time to actually do it even to the middle .
i came to the <unk> .
and before i came to the <unk> , i was playing with my best girlfriend in <unk> .
<unk> is an organization or a project of organized .
but i was not a good <unk> that i could just do that because we had a place where we could just go .
we had a <unk> , where we could do our <unk> .
and the head of <unk> helped us feel that we could tell our problems of our problems , and he could tell us , and could we sort of talk about all the questions .
and then i came to the <unk> , <unk> .
and this is a project where young people without having a sense of trying to get the ability to go through ,
that really did really good , and i realized , art is something that i also <unk> me .
through <unk> , and the contact is a filmmaker .
he made the film <unk> over the life of my friends and me .
and the film is a lot of awards .
we realized that people were interested in our history .
he was a very special feeling , because we never saw that people were listening to us .
and that was so a moment i thought , okay .
i do n't want to <unk> anymore .
i want to do anything from my life .
a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> for refugees , to refugees , for refugees , to the idea of the <unk> <unk> .
but since i got up in the <unk> building , i ended up to a <unk> , and the title is <unk> one to four .
so i was right .
i was playing with .
and the great thing is that after a performance , two editors <unk> to me .
and i asked me if i was going to be interested in doing a lot of <unk> .
i thought , great , <unk> .
i 'm going to do .
and i was <unk> for the <unk> , <unk> <unk> and one of my parts of a play , a play <unk> that i also became <unk> for the european <unk> .
and i actually won him .
now , i 'm now studying the school dropout for <unk> and film <unk> in the third year , and i 'm <unk> of the <unk> .
and that would n't be n't possible for me , if not one or organizations like <unk> or projects like <unk> would have been used for me .
they would open me to me , they 've been open to me , they showed me ways to me , how i can put my place in the society .
and i 'm going to come up with them .
each of you have the opportunity to help people get to help the second chance to help and find their lives or your position in society .
because the people , every day , come from a hundred refugees , and every one of them are full of hope and each of them have a big potential .
they managed to have a huge determination to make a lot of terrible hurdles .
and with this determination , you can actually be a tremendous profit for germany , and for every single one of us .
and i could actually tell a thousand things that you can do , but i do n't have more enough time , although there 's been a minute , i brought you a minute .
now , <unk> you now , you can not tell your cell phone , you ca n't tell you that you can not be able to tap code .
scan the code , and then they come to the side of <unk> with lots of incentives , what they can do .
and that would help us very well .
i 'm going to talk to you now for your engagement and we 're going to see sure .
and then scan the code .
i <unk> it .
many of them have no mobile phone .
is you so virtuous , or what ?
okay .
thank you .
<unk> yes .
you 've got a <unk> trip .
i 'm happy that we have contact .
my name is robin .
my <unk> is about easier to talk .
i come from austria , that 's in vienna .
but i 'm glad i 'm going to be very glad to be here today 's really beautiful .
i 'm going to be a very comfortable here .
and this is no phrase , that 's a feeling .
yes , yes , in contrast to the other <unk> , i 'm not here to be able to wipe you across anything .
i did n't know what .
but it 's so , i mean , i read writing in my leisure , and then this talk , mostly in <unk> <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> like this .
yes , and i was asked , and i was asked to read a couple of texts that 's read the whole program .
and that 's exactly what i 'm going to do .
yes .
i start with a joke .
meet two chickens .
so , that 's one , says , two english children , i 'm talking about two english , so <unk> , but <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , i 'm going to take a very funny , and <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
tell the other yeah .
hey , <unk> do n't have about <unk> me .
so here we have been the level .
the first text is a little <unk> that i wrote .
i devoted it to a person who has been devoted to me in the time .
it 's wearing the title .
and you know , she did n't understand it .
when your head in my lap was <unk> the rest of my ceiling .
my leg was also under my ceiling on my ceiling , was outside the ceiling .
my leg was walking through the ceiling .
it 's about her head to be on my lap , the rest of you , the rest of you , the rest of your ceiling , in the ceiling , your leg outside the ceiling .
this has been a tremendous thing when about my leg ,
it was very romantic .
so the next text i 've been devoted to one person who means a very much way .
that 's my grandpa .
we have no contact since .
my <unk> grandfather was a <unk> .
as a child , he 's got <unk> .
just like that , yes .
yes , even more <unk> text .
it 's not going to be better .
jesus is <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> .
but where was jesus when he should be <unk> that <unk> <unk> ?
gives you think , yes ?
did i have been brought my <unk> ?
next text .
the next text is a little longer .
it 's actually getting a half hours .
so .
read faster .
is the beginning of a novel that i do in <unk> writing writing .
ah , it 's about <unk> guys , so the adventures of a guy that goes back to the hairs , and a little bit of <unk> .
but i 'm going to be <unk> , but i 'd like to distance back to this point of being aware of the <unk> .
because i never rob my hair .
chapter one .
when i get <unk> my head .
it 's like the air that he tried to fill .
yes , i 'm not coming .
a very hard day .
the next text is also a little <unk> .
most people do n't understand .
i mean , i do n't think of myself .
and that comes , i 'd like to play with my vocabulary and with my language .
i 've always liked to speak with me .
and then , then come out of these things .
it 's wearing the title .
and it 's a little bit strange though .
may be the <unk> that i 've ever written .
we can see that we can .
yes , we <unk> .
we can .
we <unk> .
i 'm not talking about it .
but i can .
i could have .
i do n't see .
yes , i did n't understand .
no idea .
yes , yeah , sorry of me .
i always tell you , either or no .
the next piece of doing what to do with text .
it 's kind of a little <unk> .
i wrote that back for insects .
very polite .
yes , even more <unk> text .
is a little <unk> .
and if i 'm going to do it , if i think you could say your three .
my text carries the title , all good things are cool .
so , <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
so , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and scratch , and then it will be better and yeah .
it 's a beautiful moment .
yes , still <unk> <unk> , which is another one .
and in fact , if i 'm going to do so do that , that we could do this kind of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , we all try that .
right , that 's what the wind makes .
the text carries the title , and here 's the text .
yes .
fun for you .
the <unk> text is just one sentence .
i like to write a writing <unk> .
this is a <unk> commercial pun .
it 's written by <unk> s .
<unk> s ?
yes , yes .
fun for you .
yes , still <unk> .
this is written in <unk> .
and it 's a very long sentence .
i think it 's almost impossible to explain in <unk> <unk> , which is the point .
here , another text .
this day is a <unk> .
it 's the title of text .
this day is a <unk> , and he knows it .
he already saw it before i have it like this .
he <unk> my <unk> , then he would leave me .
i could pass in him later .
i did the joy .
it was <unk> it as a <unk> , and all of the other days ago , and i put back to sleep .
with a <unk> <unk> , where else ?
and intent is not going to give him more like the <unk> .
and i 'd be able to wake up in this later , i ca n't even traded a <unk> day .
is hope , right ?
now it 's time for a little joke .
what was albert einstein , when he did n't liked his steak ?
i <unk> .
so .
letter <unk> sounds like the cow .
that 's why it 's funny .
yes , the next text has learned the paper .
is rather what political political .
so , i do n't just say , `` do n't just make fun things . ''
i also read the very , most political things .
and that 's what i often ask .
and , yes , i wrote this text here .
he 's wearing his title .
my father came from vienna , then my mother and i made out of her .
yes .
we would have the <unk> .
thank you very much .
yes , i 'd like to do a little bit of ads .
i can do n't have a business business or so , that 's why i need to do that .
and i 'm also <unk> , and i also do a <unk> <unk> in vienna .
can you come up .
and yes , i 'm <unk> , i 'm actually <unk> .
and , yes .
i 'm just going to call that .
it goes on .
more ads .
this is a little ads that i wrote .
feet .
and the realm of vitamin d .
so the <unk> .
vitamin <unk> .
it 's very funny .
i want to write a joke about your girlfriend 's <unk> , but the <unk> was just flat .
yes , it 's not a <unk> .
so , you know , you have to stop the <unk> , you know , <unk> the <unk> <unk> of it .
yes .
thank you very much .
they were great .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
so let me start with a <unk> question .
why do you want to do <unk> ?
i think everybody else should be used to be wondering if he can give up at least possibly the society at least .
the answer is clear .
we now know that life expectancy is just about <unk> percent .
that is , you know , there is any environmental environmental , <unk> give the influence on <unk> .
why do we even know that again ?
why are we going to <unk> <unk> messages from the <unk> that we confront the part of each other ?
you 've got to remember the guilty 15 years ago .
it was fat .
you thought , if you 're fat out of food , we 're going to be <unk> and get healthy old .
what 's going to be <unk> with <unk> <unk> shelves with different <unk> in american <unk> , and what nothing changed that americans have become <unk> every year .
then you said , ah , no .
but not the fat .
it 's the carbs .
so , what 's going to be <unk> like the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> and so on .
so it 's going to open back to new <unk> supply of <unk> .
how all the <unk> were ?
now , the reason is , for my taste for , at least , is that we <unk> into <unk> <unk> with <unk> wisdom .
in fact , for example , for a <unk> <unk> here .
you all know the <unk> .
<unk> published a lot of <unk> magazine a new <unk> .
the top <unk> of the <unk> <unk> for this year .
keith richards became seven years .
then the newspaper died .
or this lady here .
jean <unk> .
the oldest person who has ever lived on the earth .
<unk> .
i know there are people who say , they 're <unk> , but they 're not going to find their sexuality .
jean <unk> is actually <unk> .
and she was talking to <unk> with <unk> , but with <unk> , and then they went back to <unk> , with <unk> the path of virtue and smoking .
and with <unk> , you have died .
what is that ?
not that cigarettes are healthy .
but it tells us that aging is very complicated , and we need to need clean evidence , and we need to ask simple knowledge .
i 'm going to do a simple question , and a very simple problem , which is women in different countries , women are older than men .
what is that ?
we now know it .
so that 's where testosterone is what 's going to be produced in the male <unk> .
and there are very simple evidence of that , <unk> men are just as old as women .
now , can everyone think if that 's a <unk> <unk> .
austria is a <unk> country .
but it 's still getting better , not afraid .
generally , we need to confuse two-thirds with <unk> .
sound complicated , but it 's easy to illustrate the usual thing .
so , you know , you know , somebody who did n't want to grandma , and ask , what do you have to do with it , or you know , how do you have become a way to get it ?
ah .
grandma has <unk> every day of 10 cigarettes .
that 's the secret of your age , right ?
the ten cigarettes may not have a <unk> .
but they have <unk> and granny would be <unk> without the ten cigarettes .
even hard signs are not always <unk> .
so , for example , there 's a very hard number of numbers that shows that people who show people who are going to visit high times more than people who do n't do that .
all right .
is <unk> .
is that the <unk> <unk> ?
no .
it 's because people just just have enough money in the bag to be good in the pocket of her age and the <unk> conditions .
but if i 'm going to give a group of <unk> to forage , and these pack with 20 percent longer than <unk> , which has n't been <unk> , but otherwise , it 's actually going to be the same thing , i 'm actually going to be able to get a <unk> factor in nutrition
and in fact , these are trials .
so , to tell you , the <unk> is very <unk> , but i agree with my enemies , and that 's what i agree with my enemies , that <unk> <unk> is a result .
and that works for many different organisms .
for example , with bacteria .
you see this <unk> <unk> of bacteria .
if we put the fast , in the <unk> line , there 's been a lot longer .
the same is true for <unk> , <unk> fly in the united states , and only only showed that it 's even <unk> for monkeys .
it 's not about being thin .
it also works at <unk> of the kitchen kitchen .
and this is another experiment that was done in the united states .
what 's going on here ?
you 've taken <unk> <unk> , and you have the so-called <unk> to <unk> , a <unk> diet where you have so many <unk> here and night .
and who do you want the mice , the mice have become dick , and have had <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and bad <unk> .
now , you 've taken a video game to take video camera , and that has been sent that same exact same number of <unk> <unk> that was <unk> .
they have nothing to eat the day in the day , they have been eating twice as much .
and these <unk> are still born and healthy and it does n't have a <unk> .
although both mice were feeding <unk> .
both of them have been eating a lot .
they have a sick and others .
so what 's going on here ?
it 's going to be a process called cellular <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
whenever they are organisms , or cells , by cells , are <unk> by <unk> the organism , <unk> parts of the cell or <unk> constituents to make it again .
that makes sense .
and that looks like this .
you can see , like , in the cell , they 're <unk> , <unk> , a crap that would be <unk> during the ages .
the <unk> , with the stomach , the constituents are going to be <unk> , and the cell as a energy as a energy .
this is the longest damage that are believed in the age .
this is a molecular <unk> of the <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> often talk about .
so , to put it together , a lot of <unk> are living in different organisms .
and it 's probably probably to assume that this is also working with people .
and we 're learning that they do n't need to be able to fight every little piece of data on the day with 20 <unk> .
no .
but you should say , if you have hunger , ah , maybe it 's just going to be the <unk> tape .
embrace her hunger like a friend .
and that also makes sense of mind .
so , while <unk> nine percent of history has the human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human beings , if he was hungry ?
right , it 's gone .
we routinely get the fridge when we have hunger .
and that 's safe against biology .
now , of course , we know , and that 's already in the bible , in a bible , of course , <unk> <unk> 's <unk> , the mind is ready , but the meat is weak .
paradise looks very different to us .
here 's already <unk> <unk> in a <unk> paradise .
the three <unk> here is good , the food all day , it 's also .
and that 's sort of the actual <unk> .
so we 're looking looking for substances , which is the molecular response to the <unk> , although the organism eats .
this could be interesting to people whose <unk> are not enough to be <unk> <unk> .
and it may be helping one of the hardest <unk> of life .
so the question is we can do the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , even though you eat ?
and we have many hundred , the thousand substances , a natural issue .
we 've actually found one , which is called <unk> .
now , <unk> is a substance that is <unk> in all these organisms , but it 's also less than all the organisms as well .
in the skin , it 's at the <unk> .
<unk> people have already <unk> less <unk> in the skin as a <unk> .
and if we 're going to be <unk> on human cells , for example , here 's what you see .
this is the <unk> box here .
is the <unk> , the nucleus is , we 'll give you a little bit of it , and we see many thousands of these little <unk> in the cell , that 's the crap that 's going to be in the age of <unk> , <unk> .
the <unk> cells would look like this .
and this is working in different organisms .
for example , here 's shown in a <unk> .
so we 've got to think of that , and we found the molecular <unk> <unk> .
because of course , these organisms are also longer .
and the answer is , again , you see the typical <unk> <unk> of a <unk> .
it 's simple <unk> .
after <unk> days , that 's all dead , after <unk> , that 's about half of dead .
whenever we 're giving back to drinking water , the animals get older and better .
we also know that human cells that we have <unk> from <unk> <unk> in culture , about three times as long as we can do with <unk> .
and the latest research has also been close to the way that life is going to be generated by <unk> .
and is not just the life , it 's also the <unk> .
and these are <unk> <unk> .
so .
now , of course , you want to know what 's going to come from ?
as the name is saying , it 's been discovered in the sperm , there 's where it comes in very high concentrations .
but i can also recreate them <unk> , too , in <unk> green pepper <unk> , and a product from <unk> <unk> , which is a lot of <unk> <unk> , which is so much more sinister .
and we would say , if <unk> does n't help <unk> <unk> , by the crap , can it be able to be able to <unk> it ?
so , you know , you know , the common denominator of all <unk> diseases is that during the age of the age , <unk> in the brain .
and we did some experiments .
you 're going to wonder , we have done the flies in fruit flies .
and in fact , flies will be <unk> when they 're old .
you have more <unk> in the brain when you 're old .
and the molecular mechanisms that are really similar to memory is like people .
now , do you ask yourself , how about the devil has measured the memory of fruit flies ?
this is the experiment that we 've done together with stefan seals from college berlin .
you take a hundred fruit flies , and you put this one giving a smell that you love .
<unk> .
and let 's talk about that .
then you take the same fly , they give you into the next chamber , and give you the opposite of the smell that you love , which is <unk> .
and we can enjoy the <unk> as well as they <unk> <unk> .
classical <unk> .
then again , you take the same fly , they 're going to do this .
so the travel goes down here in the <unk> , you see that .
and if you 're coming down here , you 're going to give you out of one side and <unk> from other side .
where do they go ?
okay .
to <unk> .
except the two .
these are the <unk> .
or , you say , you have character .
i love my <unk> , and i do n't want to leave me through this <unk> reward .
okay .
but is this <unk> form of character that is born with the age .
not only in flying .
and we could actually get the <unk> of the fly through <unk> to a <unk> , to a <unk> level .
and the <unk> that happened in the brain were lost again .
this means , <unk> does n't just change against coordination , but also against <unk> diseases , perhaps .
and this is important , because we do n't want to increase the face of life per capita race .
it does n't matter to prevent the time of the <unk> .
and i do n't want to leave you , without you to give you a couple of handy tips we may be younger .
<unk> <unk> .
it 's not about that you can reduce weight or like that .
there 's actually now in austria 's group of <unk> people who eat a day , and they eat a day .
this is the so-called so-called <unk> under the line of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and that 's the most good thing .
that means it 's <unk> .
avoid <unk> .
it 's not about carbs ca n't be dangerous at all .
it 's really about candy .
now , you know , you know , <unk> are <unk> , to diabetes , even if they 're born .
and you know that sugar can be processed the growth of tumors .
here you see , <unk> <unk> .
after 30 days , that 's all dead .
<unk> <unk> of glucose .
to produce a <unk> effect .
there 's just one example , which is working in almost all these organisms .
you 're going to eat fruit and vegetables .
now , avoid the gift of being a lot of <unk> or <unk> .
you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , <unk> , <unk> cancer .
this is not under conditions for vitamin d .
we may be a level of <unk> in the winter of the winter , because vitamin d is going to be formed by sunlight in the skin .
there are at least three times a week , a week , that is trivial .
cigarettes , for example , for example , for the <unk> , for example , for example , for instance , for example , they 're going to cost a cost for <unk> 10 to six years .
in times of the eternal <unk> , the quiet .
the influence of praying and blood pressure on the life expectancy is the life expectancy .
because monks are living as women as women .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> , live longer than <unk> .
<unk> live longer than <unk> .
but <unk> live still still longer than <unk> .
only <unk> are dying as a <unk> .
what is that ?
people think that has to do with some component .
no way , no way .
now , if you 're going to be a <unk> at the window , i 'm going to pretend with <unk> <unk> .
and what you see in your mind is probably happening in your <unk> .
<unk> scaling , <unk> and whatever , are in fact , under alcohol , under circumstances .
that 's why alcohol has <unk> <unk> .
it 's a permanent partner , or i want to be associated with longevity .
you should n't live in a much <unk> street .
now think about the same way .
but this is nothing to do with nothing .
it 's about <unk> .
you can measure a little bit closer to a much <unk> street , the more <unk> he 's in the blood .
and also , when he says , i used to be used to it all .
i can sleep well , and the noise does n't do it .
is not true .
he still has more <unk> in the blood , and that 's bad .
sunlight condition should be limited because of course .
now we now know that <unk> is very good metabolic effects .
in fact , it can lower the <unk> .
and we also know that creatures and <unk> mice are protecting <unk> against <unk> .
the way that was , by the way , with our grandmothers , with <unk> , and so forth .
not without sense .
several studies show that dark chocolate can be dementia against dementia .
recently , a beautiful study , which has shown that <unk> <unk> is a set of <unk> chocolate per day , can make the <unk> of a <unk> .
you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , from coffee , here is thinner .
there are studies that show that , there are studies that do n't show that .
so what 's clear is , coffee against diabetes , and therefore improves their metabolic performance .
and coffee is also a good way of <unk> , because he solves <unk> how we can show up with <unk> <unk> from paris .
<unk> , <unk> and intricate study in the hundred million people have been studied in 100,000 years to have shown that people who <unk> every day , handful of kids will lower <unk> number six percent .
this is a tremendous value for <unk> research .
and this is true for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
but not for peanuts , the <unk> are actually not beans in the tray .
the only way they 're going to call them nuts , ok ?
but that 's actually actually beans .
so , for peanuts , this is not .
the next point is a little tricky .
now , do you avoid the recording from a lot of animal protein and <unk> , and <unk> , but only when they 're between <unk> and <unk> .
so , you know , a very nice new study shows that if you take a lot of animal proteins , you take a lot of animal proteins that make you increase your influence for much more powerful than if they were a strong smokers .
this is not the time for the time where animal proteins are good , and it 's not true of <unk> kids or teenagers who need the animal proteins , and it 's not
in fact , they avoid <unk> .
whatever you do , you 're going to be able to attract , friedrich nietzsche , who said that the <unk> , the <unk> , which is <unk> health .
everything else is listening to the office .
this is the gentleman of <unk> who lived after this regime , and he 's been <unk> .
he comes from my home from my home to <unk> , he 's never sick .
and he 's doing it very well .
he 's not a <unk> alone , it 's no anecdote , but he 's living in a <unk> , where there 's a lot of healthy <unk> .
he was following the <unk> that i said to you today .
we should have been able to do all the <unk> experiments , but not the important fact .
so , that the <unk> of the <unk> , i 'm not going to be a <unk> , but to be a <unk> , and then finally a <unk> .
you 'd be <unk> to the old people , and it could be one of the <unk> mistake of our culture .
<unk> wrote the biggest novel of <unk> a year before his death .
the brothers <unk> .
a piece of work , with the contemporary critic of all the juvenile <unk> .
thank you for your attention .
i want to start with a question i do .
one question , where no one has to come up , because it 's a little bit of <unk> , because of them is lonely ?
but the <unk> is very low .
<unk> still than i thought .
but it probably probably has reasons why they do n't say , well , the people who are , you know , people who would n't have .
many people confuse <unk> and loneliness and think that would be <unk> .
that 's not the case at the case .
and you 're actually seeing loneliness is actually more likely to be a phenomenon of people as alone .
maybe it 's also because they 're not saying , because the question is <unk> .
is you feel lonely or is you lonely ?
you can feel lonely , without lonely .
and you can be lonely .
loneliness has also been a lot of shame .
it 's also going to have some of the <unk> of loneliness to loneliness .
loneliness leads in shame and shame in loneliness .
loneliness needs time .
so now , nobody will have been saying in the couple of seconds i gave you .
loneliness needs to be <unk> .
loneliness needs time to be aware of the time .
and loneliness is also needs to talk about that .
and that exercise , we do n't own the exercise .
we do n't own the language we have to recognize ourselves , when are we lonely ?
there are two <unk> that i 've been sitting in again .
one part of mankind says , you 're at the beginning of lonely .
from birth to death , you 're actually just lonely .
there are a few moments in life where you can do this .
so these people often go to <unk> , and get rid of the day .
i do n't have any time , i do n't know .
and then there may be a little bit less of the two , which is all connected .
i actually do n't have this , so , i 'm just a part of the big universe .
and there 's the great group that i 've also been hearing about this way .
you think , ok , i 'm lonely , and the next day , oh , it 's all together .
and when we look at loneliness , we 're still looking at the whole great loneliness .
and the loneliness of the <unk> , the loneliness in a intensive intensive care .
but about these <unk> , these great <unk> <unk> , but i want to talk about the little bit about the mundane , the everyday <unk> , where loneliness can be done in so <unk> .
i do n't want to talk about burden and <unk> .
loneliness at the other level of the other , we do n't think of what we do n't think of remembering loneliness to us .
the photographer photographer <unk> <unk> <unk> a couple of photographs that i want to show you .
it 's how easy it gets to us in the other level of it .
and we do n't know if these people really felt lonely in this moment .
but who does n't know that moment in the moment of the event where you think , all of them are talking to each other , only you 're lost in the corner , and anybody does n't have to <unk> .
all of the sudden , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , sure .
maybe some of them have already seen today .
and what you do is you do <unk> the cell phone to very often , you can see very well , you can see very well , the <unk> , the <unk> on the mobile phone .
so , you see , you see , you look at the display on the display .
now , what we do n't do here .
yes , and then there 's loneliness , which is the <unk> of you , the loneliness of one of them sitting on <unk> stage hundreds of <unk> faces in front of you , and you have to leave something in the hope that you do n't forget your text .
these are the <unk> that you see from the outside .
we ascribe to other people .
but i 'm sure there are people in the room that are also born in the room who feels like the rest of the rest of the lives that you 've been trying to try and try and tried to distract these loneliness from <unk> .
and there are also people who are lonely , because they have to be lonely , because they have to be the other people 's other people , it 's because of death , or because of a <unk> .
there 's nothing that there are not a lot of people , including people that they 're connected to them around them .
and there are people who do n't have to find a contact of themselves , and that 's why they 're not lonely .
i <unk> that the digital loneliness .
sit down to the analog loneliness .
the analog loneliness is all familiar .
these are people who think of their opinion after their social contacts .
it 's always relatively relative .
there is no official number , no serious number when somebody has enough human beings , when you do n't .
we 're going to see the old people .
it 's the analog form of loneliness .
but since we all live in cities , with many people with facebook , or with twitter or facebook , this digital loneliness is always bigger .
you can be connected to hundreds of people without being really connected to one people .
is it in the analog loneliness of human relationships , which is lacking in the digital loneliness of the digital loneliness of the relationships .
and these two forms of loneliness are very often more often .
it 's also that the analog loneliness is a little bit of <unk> .
whereas the digital loneliness is good .
and it 's the <unk> that the digital loneliness will still increase in the future , when the possibilities are larger .
i do n't know if you 're really similar to this sense of loneliness that will be very similar to be loneliness .
or would you find a new term .
but that 's also sort of the problems of <unk> generation .
almost bigger than the loneliness itself is the fear of loneliness , and from this fear of loneliness , of loneliness , is ready to do .
so , <unk> , the great <unk> , a <unk> person has written a wonderful <unk> .
you know , in that , you describes what people are doing things to be not alone .
they 're building cathedrals , they see kids that are lonely or alone .
but the <unk> , they did n't named by <unk> the fear of loneliness , which is money .
<unk> .
things hold things .
both of the process has already been aware of loneliness , because it 's at least a contact is creating a contact and the things that you have acquired .
problem is that it 's very short to help and keep it , this <unk> against loneliness .
so we have to buy new things again .
i 'd seen the advertisement for a <unk> label .
and the <unk> <unk> of mobile phone communication with the <unk> of it .
and what you have to do with panties , do n't know , but apparently it 's also working .
so loneliness has nothing to do with the <unk> of loneliness , among people .
<unk> <unk> wrote a wonderful poem , and there is a verse at the worst is loneliness .
hand on it 's heart , who does n't know ?
and , in a relationship , or the other relationship or the other people who are looking at <unk> , and all of all of all of us feel terrible alone alone , and then asking the question , who is this person ?
did i have to do with that ?
one study is saying that in the <unk> women , they 're married , married , with children .
evidence is , because i do n't know if i 've invented the study self so often i told you .
but now , it 's actually totally not true because at least , in the way , it 's mostly most of the reaction , and the response is the way the people in front of me .
the answer is that , of course , is not quite a <unk> .
loneliness is a familiar , and yet we do n't talk about them .
talk about <unk> about loneliness about sex .
i 've probably seen that .
still , as you 've got to think , again , to think , what do i do ? ''
who is this person in my bed ?
and as a form of loneliness that do n't necessarily have to do with the quality of the sexual quality .
there is nothing to do with the quality of relationship .
it 's just there .
not only talk about it , because we do n't look at them .
we 're not talking about it in the workforce .
in the professional , loneliness is <unk> than we think .
i was sitting on <unk> <unk> <unk> and observed a group of five <unk> , and better , three with suit and two .
the two men have learned , they have some women in the sleep .
and in between , something <unk> , something <unk> with the <unk> in the hand of <unk> .
i think , i 'm not going to do this , i 'm not going to do that of this shape of loneliness that everybody has been able to be able to <unk> in his workforce .
it 's the loneliness of the <unk> .
but it 's also the loneliness of the <unk> .
we all know the <unk> or i see , here may be some couple of their life on <unk> .
in <unk> , in <unk> circles in places , in <unk> bars , the often often do n't know what they are doing .
where you 're going to wake up .
it 's a form of loneliness that is not talking about .
it 's also a way of being <unk> as loneliness as being <unk> .
this is a insulation bay .
and i 've got a <unk> saying that he was called <unk> by a client , and who has said , it 's what 's going on , you can not imagine .
a <unk> was alone in the lunchroom .
so with that , he <unk> himself to <unk> .
and two months later , he 's <unk> .
loneliness is never coming alone .
it 's always in connection with other feelings .
she has beautiful siblings , and she has ugly siblings .
we all know the ugly siblings .
fear , despair in despair and the shame .
but we should n't forget the beautiful siblings .
the freedom to the yearning is the yearning .
so my response is to look at loneliness .
come , and you 're going to be a flood and tide .
and let 's do you , and let 's do n't take her .
because there 's a little more worse than loneliness , and that 's the emptiness that may be a little bit of loneliness when you do n't feel nothing more .
loneliness is part of life .
so , since i 've been thinking very much about loneliness , i 've been changing two things .
for one of my <unk> , i do n't have to know any more like a <unk> dictator , i 'm going to say that i 'm going to say , why he ca n't get <unk> , because i may be losing the people , maybe i 'm a lonely .
i 've been ever since , since i 've been since , i 've been managed to be the loneliness in my life , i 've got people coming and going to go .
it 's like the <unk> that you do .
and i 've been getting free .
people come and go to waves immediately , if you could have a friendship or a partnership .
as a child , i found my parents .
and you can do that , you can not have any <unk> <unk> without someone to start with somebody .
it 's in the <unk> or in the economy .
every time it was <unk> it .
as a child , i found that as said .
and as a young adult , i 've been incredibly incredible to have this openness to this openness .
but only since i 've been doing that , i have been engaged with loneliness , it 's actually going to be able to open up with me so much .
you see , you can see it 's lonely .
thank you very much .
yes , thank you very much .
i 've got three degrees here .
a <unk> <unk> and a <unk> .
so now i 'm going to ask you to do that , if you can take one of them , you 're going to take a chance to take you ?
most of them would decide for the <unk> .
and this is a <unk> idea .
and why is why ?
because we 're using the lowest way to produce the biggest effect .
in health , we somehow do it differently .
so , we 're going to be able to get the potential with the biggest effect , and get us to other strategies .
we 're going to decide for example , for example , for example , and that 's for sports .
but great <unk> , but great effort .
that 's why not so valuable .
or we decide for the <unk> .
that 's for diet .
but it 's still very large , but still very big effort .
that 's why not so valuable .
and i want to talk to you today as you can produce with the least of the world 's biggest <unk> .
if you deal with prevention and health , you 're not going to be a topic of <unk> .
and the topic is obesity .
and the issue is , in germany , was not a topic in germany , about something to the <unk> .
and then the number of overweight in germany are strong .
and i asked me , what was going on in the <unk> ?
why did it all went up to the top ?
and i 've got a lot of research , and i 've been <unk> .
because it was right in the years .
what was there ?
there 's been <unk> after germany .
and we 're always getting and <unk> ?
and i kept looking at a minute .
<unk> comes from the germany .
and the obesity goes up .
and in the years , the curve is right now .
and what happens to germany ?
it 's <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and like it 's called .
and we 're always getting and <unk> ?
well , i have one and one <unk> .
because it 's clear .
sport is doing dick .
and of course , i 'm not here today to tell you that sport is doing dick .
because that 's not true .
but one of them are now in common .
the tide of new materials -- and <unk> does n't have to have that we 're going to be healthier and healthier .
so what is it ?
the diet ?
and there 's also a great study of the states .
they have the problem with obesity .
and they have introduced in the <unk> <unk> .
and then she wanted to look at what 's going on ?
and you saw , people are actually going to take less fat but less fat , but they still have still <unk> .
and that was paradox .
and so they called it <unk> .
so we can explain that ?
you can imagine you can imagine the body like a power station .
this is what we have this <unk> <unk> .
and on the one side comes out , there 's a <unk> , and we 're going to do all the <unk> , which is coming down here .
and here 's what the energy is going to be <unk> as electricity .
now , if we 're going to be <unk> here in our power station , as we use <unk> on the other side , the energy in the power station and it 's bang .
the human body is not going to bang .
it can store the energy .
and that 's in a form of fat .
our greatest and <unk> .
but what happens is , when we 've heard less as we have heard of energy , energy , and yet <unk> , it just leaves the energy .
the <unk> has dramatically <unk> .
there 's no life going on here .
we 're only even mobile .
and that 's what happened .
our grandparents are still <unk> <unk> 20 kilometers .
and we 're coming now , and we 're going to have one to two kilometers , and that 's the positive estimates .
there are studies that have five -- to <unk> feet .
i 'm going to tell you a little bit of <unk> with my friend mike .
will you give me a degrees of the chair ?
mike , are you going to be degrees ?
mike is americans .
he 's shy , he 's not going to talk about .
and he was in this trial and now here .
he 's the typical <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and he 's got a <unk> in the hand .
and mike eats always less and less and less and take less and <unk> , and yet it 's always going to be <unk> .
why ?
because mike 's just sitting there .
and i looked at how much movement mike was so mike in the morning , and he put a <unk> in the pocket , and i cried back again .
and there 's a thousand steps that we have a thousand steps .
so that was the distance , mike 's <unk> has <unk> <unk> in the morning , the car in the office , with the car in the office , of course , a little bit of coffee and evening back .
and he came up with a thousand steps .
that 's mike , mike was about 10 minutes on his legs .
<unk> hours , and fifty minutes , mike or was mike .
among these conditions , disease alone .
and mike 's not so dick , because he does n't make a lot of energy because he does n't use it again , but they 're not going to be <unk> , and the energy is <unk> .
and first of all , the energy , as you see here at its <unk> .
but energy is <unk> , which is not there .
it 's going back to a couple of people in <unk> .
and it 's also active , and it 's going to be quiet and quiet to his <unk> .
so the <unk> .
so if the energy goes into the blood , the doctors of high blood sugar and high <unk> .
and this <unk> , the <unk> , as <unk> , makes little holes all over these <unk> .
and happiness is still a very lucky floating , and it 's got to be the whole fat , and that 's the <unk> of these little wounds and we talk about <unk> or <unk> .
and now , <unk> is right under pressure , because now he 's got to pump the blood through these tight <unk> <unk> and we talk about hypertension .
and if that hypertension hits a <unk> , it 's also bang in the body .
and if this is the heart , we call the heart attack .
and if that 's the head , we call the stroke .
and in germany , every second number of heart attack and stroke .
that means , in germany , every second one is going to <unk> .
and mike is not going to be sick because he does n't become sport , but because he does n't move more .
and if you do n't know that , you 're always looking at the wrong position .
for example , a diet .
i 've got a degree , <unk> <unk> , and there 's been <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and if every book is just a centimeter thick , and we would pull that here , we would have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and i read them all of them .
and there 's in that , and that 's really important if you 're going to eat more energy than you 're using , you will use them thick .
and if you 're less energy than you use it thin .
that 's brilliant .
but why do we need to need <unk> books ?
that 's just one conclusion .
clearly , of course , is huge , but <unk> is not help .
why do a diet get a hundred percent ?
because it 's a diet , and it 's not a lifestyle .
and what 's using the things that we do here for three weeks , and there 's five weeks when we go back to this battle , again , to our normal day , to our normal lifestyle .
what 's going to be five or seven weeks ?
nothing .
except for <unk> and again in confidence that we did n't have that what we have done .
so you can talk about every new time today , every new diet , with every new <unk> , and you want to integrate that in your life , in their lifestyle .
yes or no ?
and then , if you go .
and if no , they just stay it .
because when it comes out , it 's not pure waste .
it 's the habits that decide about whether we get sick or healthy .
it 's the bad habits that make us sick .
and it 's the good habits that are healthy us healthy .
and when mike is looking at the mirror , he looks at the result of his everyday lifestyle .
when mike looks in the mirror , he looks at his everyday habits .
and when mike is looking at the mirror , and frankly , it 's too honest , it 's also where he goes along .
because if it 's more bad habits as good habits , it 's just the way it is in the direction of the way .
and when mike toward the direction of the direction , to its health , toward his goals , the direction of his dreams , he does n't need to change his whole life .
then it just needs more good habits as bad habits .
and a <unk> habits is also a great example of that that is already a weird animal .
mike has done it , for example , <unk> completely out of his life <unk> by putting every way to the car , using every dot .
and he 's sitting on the couch , he 's sitting on the couch , and we have to get back to motion again .
so he 's going to drive up in his <unk> , and then he goes up to the pots with the escalator , which is a paradox in the ground , and then it 's going to be paradox , and then it 's going to be <unk> like this .
and my grandpa would have had exactly as much as they could .
it was a farmer and who did n't have that .
that would have said , sport is for people who do n't move .
and somehow , he 's right .
why do we have to always relate to all of our precious work in our precious work of what we have the everyday lives ?
so , <unk> , we need to make a lot of a lifestyle day for a day of life every day .
but there 's a lot of easier to find the motion again where we lost them .
in the ground .
and so that 's why i invite you to a perspective today .
maybe you 're going to be able to store the situation , you 're going to go quickly for the store , and i 'm afraid that 's not a place in the first row .
and this is what we 're doing is programmed to be programmed in us .
we want to go to the shortest .
we plan our homes so we have the <unk> way .
we plan our whole lives that we have the <unk> way , but it 's not going to be there , where we do .
it 's in a completely different direction .
so you can see , you can see the <unk> you can activate and find the motion back there .
for example , i 'd like to take up .
and i 'm the only ones that always goes up and down and go down and down and down and down ,
but if i 'm there , i 'm going to be <unk> .
so , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i 'm going to be the motion that 's just there .
and if you go up , the <unk> comes down , 30 minutes <unk> , i 'm <unk> .
<unk> steps .
this is about three times the 10 minutes translated .
and a <unk> <unk> steps , if you talk about every day of every day , you will go to the end of the day , you do n't get 12 grams of your body .
that may seem relatively little sound .
but as a <unk> , as a habit , <unk> days in the year , we 're talking about four degrees of <unk> five pounds of fat .
we have not in our body .
and you give me a degrees of me , i 'm going to get <unk> .
the americans are crazy , so the question here .
this is a <unk> of five pounds of fat .
i mean , that 's what i do .
so you see what happens there with these little steps .
and if the effect is from this perspective , what do you mean , what is happening when you start in a active life .
and this <unk> that you see every day every day in your everyday day .
as soon as you get to <unk> steps every day , they 're almost close to all of them .
and then , when you feel like , then you have time , you 're going to make it back to the top .
then they still have a <unk> nor <unk> .
and they 're also getting faster and stronger .
but they do n't continue to do their health .
that 's not dependent on their health , and they do n't depending on your way .
because the most important that is most important to do every day every day .
and i 'm going to be living in a living lifestyle .
and for me , it 's more comfortable as a lifestyle , for me , it 's a tough decision that is based on the life and for me .
because i do n't think health is doing what we should need to do or do .
it 's health to do with what we want to do .
and so that 's why i 'm going to say , `` well , i 'm just going to have a idea for you .
do n't want to look at the best .
and you know , you know , you know .
step forward .
thank you very much .
<unk> like this is what leonardo da vinci is actually doing in such incredible , <unk> way to see the world with other eyes ?
and in fact , even as far as much in terms of being aware of what to do , what about the time , was unimaginable by being unimaginable ?
could we do this today ?
now , has that to do with <unk> ?
and how can we make strength and confidence for our future ?
now , let 's start with the question , what do we do to do among innovation ?
okay .
technology is even talking about research and development , for the government administration administration has the title of the federal government .
so you get me right .
that 's all great .
and we can be very proud of that , and we can be grateful that we 're going to be <unk> in such many areas that we 're going to be good around the world that we 're doing well .
so that we have a remarkable , unique wealth .
but what about the future ?
what are the challenges that are going to be a society ?
and who does n't care about the big ecological and social challenges ?
so <unk> seems to be <unk> .
a kind of <unk> .
so the economy is taking care of ecological challenges , because the entrepreneurs are going to increase great efforts that we get productivity and efficiency .
and the way that the world are going to do better , and then they have to be able to be able to be able to solve , and then they need to be <unk> , of course , to fix the damage of the new york economy .
at least <unk> .
but who says that we have to look at the whole than separated ?
how if we have our ability to extend social and cultural dimension ?
when technology innovations are also cultural innovations ?
when economic innovations are also social innovations also ?
if we could think of that , if we used to be able to work to be able to design thinking and practice , with the solution of social environmental and social challenges ?
now , if there 's completely the unknown forces , and if it could put us into a completely different , fair <unk> development ?
because how was that ?
and they wanted to have all sides , they wanted to , right ?
can we do that ?
now , ask yourself .
so far , we always have that as a contradiction .
thankfully , <unk> examples .
muhammad yunus has to <unk> with his <unk> , with his <unk> in bangladesh , a lot of <unk> <unk> poverty .
and interestingly , there 's a lot of <unk> in the direct way of what the state state has been done .
and he has <unk> as a businessman , probably to get <unk> <unk> .
so , with the opportunity , i 'm going to leave you with somebody else .
i can , i can imagine <unk> .
<unk> 's <unk> guy .
but great trained , but also his ideal failure .
and so yeah , so totally <unk> .
i like to be totally like that .
and if you see that , you think , real , you know , you do n't need to worry about our future .
yes , after studying studying , he 's actually starting to work on one of our <unk> <unk> .
it 's all good .
and this is what it totally like , and it 's too successful .
and yet , there 's something like this .
so he 's asking , he 's not even more , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , put me in my way ?
this is the entrepreneurial time that he 's going to say to the entrepreneurial problem .
<unk> are <unk> .
and that 's what he liked .
and he also liked this <unk> .
so the right now , there 's also the <unk> that he 's actually realized .
so not that he knows him personally , but so from the <unk> tell you what 's going on .
and in the middle of the middle of the t , he did n't know three options .
so , the more than it was surprised when he was introduced to him , he was introduced to him as a <unk> .
as mister <unk> .
and as a <unk> , entrepreneurs had introduced to this point .
so that 's the great joy of collaboration , so with young people , so his experience .
and the two , they found each other .
and they 've met more more than more over .
so how if we just looked at these these talks about the two times ?
yes , mister <unk> , so that 's exactly what it was .
now what 's the difference between the <unk> between the world 's difference between <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> ?
i do n't have that yet .
so , so , , then , then , then , then , then , then , then we 're going to catch the question of what is <unk> <unk> ?
so name says , yes .
organic markets , artificial products , artificial customers , artificial structures , there 's a <unk> .
and you can give up quite quite a pattern of mindset where the big forms of things are happening .
and even <unk> <unk> , even if that 's completely clean .
what is a <unk> ?
so , <unk> , you 've got a little bit of it , you know , it 's not it 's not the little copy of a big company .
it 's something else .
it 's got a completely different character .
because it 's not going to be <unk> .
no <unk> customers , no <unk> <unk> , nothing known .
so , of course , a temporary organization is a temporary organization that has to be a business model , to find a business model , to develop the profitable model , of course , , of course , that 's particularly important , and then you scale it .
and you 're going to understand that , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , in the way , of course , different ways , are different , different ways .
yeah , that 's obvious me .
but after what do we look for ?
so , i 'm going to say , `` i 'm going to say , `` i 'm going to take a care of <unk> money , right ?
so i also got a degree of , which is a very good , so <unk> seminar in berlin would you recommend that ?
that 's called <unk> .
how do you successful your company <unk> and raise your life on your life .
oh no .
i mean , really ?
what if you have money , you have to have <unk> your <unk> money , what 's your <unk> ?
so do you have a career , as a <unk> , or what ?
what happens to your engagement , as i know ?
and also , we look at the <unk> .
so , the statistics of <unk> are not giving you a <unk> perspective , because seventy percent of all <unk> are already a few years ago in a much more cheap financial situation than front of their big .
money is always the result of a successful company and a good word company .
well , sure , money is an energy for enterprise .
and it 's the foundation that we have in terms of economic growth .
but it 's never the goal of a company .
yes , what is the goal ?
the company ?
so , if i pick out what i do . '' but i do n't know what i 'm talking about , no way without the right way .
and so , goals have to be a way of measurable time , and so on .
and if i do n't have this all there , so that 's how i can do something that i do n't know what i want to look for ?
so that 's not a good feeling .
so , like , i want to decide because , and risks , that feels like all of it all , and <unk> .
yes , <unk> welcome to the company .
but i may be there .
one thread .
so , this is already <unk> , so much secret .
successful <unk> of generation <unk> .
a <unk> for <unk> .
so , how do you say today ?
<unk> that i , <unk> ?
so we 're going to say , `` <unk> . ''
the <unk> crisis and <unk> and <unk> cultural uncertainty .
so helps them help .
i mean , i can give you one of them .
okay .
yes , thank you , mister <unk> .
but there 's just a question on it .
you can see that you can see that one of the important qualities is good questions .
can we go through one after the another , that i may be able to get this ?
so the first one is , i 'm here , and what do i want to do here ?
yes , <unk> , there 's a <unk> , which is what 's going to move that over you , is bigger than you ?
what do you do on the world ?
what have people who do with you work with ?
what are you ready ?
so what are your core , maybe you have a unconscious <unk> ?
why is this so important that it is so important ?
because that 's your cure .
and how did we learn that ?
and if you 're going to build a ship , not to do the men together , and i 'm going to start to start to gather into a hot game , they 're teaching them , but teaching them , yearning after the whole , <unk> ocean .
yes , good .
so , then i 'm going to ask me the next question .
what 's my favorite <unk> ?
so what does that mean ?
yes , <unk> now can you see your goal really time .
colorful color in detail , but i mean , `` i mean , '' i mean , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , what you 're going to do , what you do n't want to be on you .
do you know the story with the pink elephant ?
i think it 's going to be a degree .
not ?
<unk> .
so , pass away .
do n't think you have no pink elephant .
okay ?
work ?
so no pink elephant .
did you see ?
no pink elephant .
do you see ?
so it 's like , if we focus on what we do n't want to do .
so , what 's the only way ?
so , you know ?
yeah , yeah , imagine what you want to do .
so <unk> <unk> or maybe the <unk> on the <unk> .
but guess what you 've been doing .
by the way , i 'm going to think of what you can like , right ?
i brought you there .
<unk> if you 're the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> smith .
who ?
at <unk> , to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i <unk> <unk> of you to <unk> my <unk> at <unk> the time , the <unk> <unk> .
i <unk> the glass in the master 's <unk> .
i was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i 'd like to <unk> my <unk> into the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> smith .
oh , but <unk> , <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> as <unk> <unk> 's <unk> , you know , one of them have a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
it 's <unk> a <unk> of <unk> .
the real <unk> is <unk> <unk> ?
and what 's interesting about how it looks like ?
is you what noticed ?
has changed anything ?
okay .
okay and the flower goes .
okay .
so , then we 're looking at the time we see the bear .
and that 's action .
<unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> smith .
who ?
at <unk> , to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i <unk> <unk> of you to <unk> my <unk> at <unk> the time , the <unk> .
i <unk> the glass in the master 's <unk> .
i was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i 'd like to <unk> my <unk> into the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> smith .
and <unk> , how do you do this ?
so , i still know , i was also shocked .
i was really shocked .
when i first saw the first time . ''
i could n't think it could be .
and a lot more shocked , i was as a result of the head , could it be that i actually made the whole time ?
through my life .
and okay , i 'm going to understand that .
in order to stop the immediate <unk> to prevent most of our perception and our <unk> .
but what 's going on now ?
what <unk> i was and what am i doing ?
and therefore , therefore , tell you your perception and you can find your perception somewhere else , you have another important entrepreneurial entrepreneurial fortune health quality .
well , yeah , thank you , then we 'll go to the next question .
how could i actually come to my goal ?
so , that 's a good question .
because of course , i 'm going to ask you every time , and it 's not going to be <unk> .
yes , <unk> , there 's good news for you .
this is going to be easier to you than far as far as far .
because if you realize your focus is , your inner propulsion , and if you give you a very <unk> target , i promise you will actually happen in there .
almost automatically .
you 're not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to suggest that you 're going to be suggesting that things are going on .
these famous <unk> that you have under the morning .
and still , i 'm going to recommend what i 'm going to recommend , if you can look good , who you could say , who you could ask with advice that could be more input to be done with home .
and you have also a big role .
the <unk> have a great <unk> .
<unk> di <unk> , if they did n't want to invited to his <unk> , <unk> in florence .
for lunch , the famous big table .
and that 's totally different people .
so scientists , <unk> , politicians , bankers , famine engineers , architects , architects and he has <unk> <unk> .
but not in our sense of the way that we went in today , yes , who is going through ?
who is right ?
and in fact , that suddenly , from these different types of things that we have emerged in this way , no way , no way of being a way of being a way of being a way of themselves in a way of themselves .
well , yes , the next question is , what is the concrete step ?
and <unk> , there are successful entrepreneurs in the reason .
rather than <unk> and management and so on , they always focus on the next step .
because what do you want to do in the field of uncertainty ?
but these are really determined , and with all the consequences .
and if it was nothing , well , you 're looking at a minute .
and even when the big , colorful , <unk> <unk> , is not going to be <unk> .
that 's why it 's so important for you to you .
you have this inner safety .
and in the mood , how did we actually learn all of these ?
although we did n't know that , and nobody said that ?
they 're also saying that you 're going to say a little bit about kids .
so , this piece of learning learn that you can look at this piece of looking at this piece of looking at this piece of craving and you can look at this piece of <unk> , you know , it 's a fun thing that is happening in a company .
and that 's actually sort of the <unk> against the uncertainty that else else are always doing .
yes , thank you .
so that 's really great .
but i do n't know , i know , in the company , i think , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you have to change a lot of bosses have happening there .
and in germany , there 's always this general mood .
and i mean , i think , that politicians need to have the politicians first of that that is changing .
okay , my boy , come up .
like go down to the water .
what do you think about how many people can change ?
ten ?
10,000 ?
ten million ?
look down here .
who are you watching ?
exactly that .
that 's the you that you can really change .
or to tell it with mahatma gandhi , looking for the change that you 're looking at in the world in the world .
think , you think , really beautiful words and great role models , but how do you want to work ?
so , for some of us , we still have <unk> <unk> on our <unk> .
and helpful in all sorts of issues of crises , or if you feel a little bit of feeling for something or if you have a <unk> , and you have to do with you .
and if you ask you in these situations , what are you so happy to ask you to say , what 's the posture you can take to feel to feel you .
so ask yourself , what you like to do is you like to talk about you .
and to conclude , ask you , what you actually are from this crisis or the , what awful is happening ,
so , i mean , if you happen to you , at least you 've been going to be paid at least .
yes .
thank you very much .
and do you think that really helps me to get me to my point ?
right .
and tell you all two things .
first of all , all over the clarity , will be able to suggest that you will be going to your cure .
that determines your perception .
and the second line on your inner race is looking at your inner mindset .
because this is what you 're going to do with you .
future creates only when we change our own perception .
do you do that ?
yes , i think .
thank you .
all good <unk> .
yes .
what do you think about our <unk> ?
nice .
really , really , <unk> ?
and how do we think of this <unk> ?
is this a new <unk> ?
i mean , yes .
clearly .
i 've seen the <unk> .
<unk> is deceived .
and that 's what 's really important .
a <unk> from the <unk> .
and no , so new <unk> , <unk> .
this is the <unk> .
and you 've just got in the great famous name of <unk> .
by robert bosch about <unk> <unk> or <unk> , or how they all are called .
but let 's go back to this mind .
and who is going to know , yes , from our <unk> of the next leonardo of our time .
you 're right , i 'm <unk> .
so maybe it would be <unk> that i 'm going to do with children and their future , because eventually children are our future .
instead , the view is the view that i enjoy most of the time .
i spend a lot of my life in prison .
four years ago , my father , and i 've got this program , entrepreneurship for prisoners of prisoners ,
we 're making <unk> <unk> , that means you can either be able to survive your own , or find a easier to be easier to make a work that you can also think .
so why am i in charge of <unk> , so those who did have already failed the great mistake ?
our program is far not as easy to understand how programs they do .
and frankly , i would have thought that the <unk> of the last place in the universe that i would work in .
so what do you think is the most important thing about childhood in childhood with the people that we work with ?
and we 've found out , it 's positive models often make emotional role models .
and if you think about why it 's in certain <unk> , and many of them are often because of the father 's not a reasonable job that he 's wearing drugs or he 's sitting in prison .
and if you think a little boy about what he wants to do from his life , he may not have a better idea about how another life could look like , because he has no better role models .
he <unk> his father .
i 'm going to show you <unk> .
martin is <unk> of our program .
his dad was an alcoholic and all the family had the life to hell .
when he was twelve , his mother died and his little brother had to go to home .
he was the <unk> of the big .
he was shy and <unk> and so the perfect sacrifice .
so to the day , as his little brother at a soccer game has been <unk> , that this is the ground that we stayed on the ground .
there 's <unk> in martin <unk> for the first time , he went to the enemy .
and on the day , it 's been respected .
and here it goes .
violence was just drawn to his life just like his father .
so how do it talk about the ones that i just described on ?
and after the childhood , many of them are unemployed or have been <unk> .
you do n't know much more different than their illegal activities and their <unk> .
and then , one day , they 're going to put people to prison in prison , and that 's exactly how you can do that , the same thing that you think about the same is not better role models .
what , do you think these people think in common when they sit together in prison ?
usually not much good .
and you get better criminals in the <unk> .
they sell drugs to treat drugs on a higher level , and plan in prison where they could be able to <unk> in the prison .
and that goes into germany to <unk> percent .
this is , in germany , every stranger will be criminals .
but then there are also people in prison that really want to change .
but then these people are wearing a <unk> on the forehead .
and there 's <unk> .
and everywhere you come , that 's their first identity .
if you 're going to look at a workplace , if you 're going to look at a home to build new private relationships all over this identity , with this identity , with this <unk> , which is hard to make them hard .
this is the problem that we are standing .
so how do we try to solve this problem ?
what is the trait , think , do you get a lot of <unk> ?
you 're going to be surprised .
it 's entrepreneurial capability .
you know , who has to have a <unk> , definitely know from <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
the only problem is , if you had a little bit of <unk> , it 's not going to land in prison .
and these qualities , we want to use this dynamic .
we start our program with a <unk> training in prison , in three <unk> .
we 're using the fundamentals of entrepreneurship and economy .
every subjects , every time , <unk> his own <unk> , and everybody takes a comprehensive part of a comprehensive part of a <unk> .
and then we 're going to teach people to the prison school at the <unk> , with the <unk> of their personal relationships and also on a variety of <unk> .
so what 's going on for our program ?
it 's a huge bandwidth , from the <unk> to agency .
we have a <unk> <unk> .
there 's a very large range of bandwidth , and i 'm happy to imagine that i 'm happy to imagine .
<unk> <unk> talent and his illusion of fast money , they 've been seduced into <unk> by cocaine .
he was always having fun to do business .
he 's then been arrested for the first time .
and this prison has not struck him very striking .
in the opposite .
he says themselves , he 's going to be prepared for his second <unk> .
<unk> was convicted of the second time .
and he just took a treatment and then on the <unk> .
and then he learned how he can use his <unk> talent .
he was released in september 13 , then october , october his agency for <unk> .
the agency running good , he can live in this now .
he turned out very good <unk> .
he 's here with me today .
who like to talk to him , you want to talk to him .
even back to martin , i had told him to start with him .
martin got a training for a training to say , and she ended up in his own time in his own <unk> .
and there 's alcohol and drugs in the agenda , of the agenda , his cycle was right fast .
he was working parallel as <unk> and as a <unk> .
20 years , he led this life .
and he 's saying , he 's saying that he does n't have a lot of life with this lifestyle .
and one day , he brought somebody to a <unk> <unk> for a <unk> <unk> , he would be convicted .
he was going to be in the <unk> part and the <unk> there has really changed his life .
he learned how he could get to more success and to make more quality of life without trying to negotiate without drugs .
and he was so excited by his knowledge that he decided to tell you this thing .
and he wanted to be part of the <unk> .
this is what happened .
now , he 's been working on us for the last two years , and <unk> our participants on their way to freedom , because he knows that if you really want to change , and if you 're going to change , and if you get the right tools that
the basis of these successes are people like them .
people who come into the prison that come to the prison that will come to the prison that come to our subjects to <unk> their subjects , with their personal plans .
these are our <unk> , who are <unk> talks in our class , these are students who are the students who do n't change the <unk> .
and these are our mentors that we have to talk to our participants right now .
and these people are taking a lot of our program .
one example .
we 're doing a exercise , a practice called <unk> .
we 're pasting in the middle of the room , a big <unk> of our participants are standing on one and our <unk> standing on the other side .
and i look at different questions .
and every time , if somebody in the room is answered this question to the line .
and here 's what we all have in common , is we 're sitting in the prison , or outside .
but also , where the differences are .
and a example of where the differences are .
i grew up in a piece of social i.q , or i had a family member of <unk> .
there are usually very many of our participants at the line , and just very few of our <unk> .
one question that i like to do , which connects us all of these together , the <unk> .
i want you to get up here .
maybe we can get a little bit in the audience .
i can see you .
it 's all .
great .
thank you very much .
i 'm going to ask you a question , and if you answer this question , you sit down , otherwise are just standing .
that 's like our line that we 're moving now .
i did in my life of illegal things that i could have been punished .
now , if you answer this question , you can ask yourself .
it 's important to be drunk car risks .
maybe that counts , maybe have been a low amount of interests .
it 's not important with the driver 's seat .
okay .
and it 's also important , maybe any workforce may not have signed to the <unk> .
all right .
most of them are .
we have a couple of angel in the room .
that 's wonderful , i 'm happy .
thank you very much , you can sit down .
so , with this question , when we put that in the field , our <unk> come very often .
and many will say , well , how much happiness you may have had .
thankfully with the parents , lucky with the environment that they were growing up , with the friends , with the friends , that you may not have been caught with you , if you have been caught when you have been caught on the edge of the <unk> or out of it .
what are the results of our work ?
<unk> percent of the alumni of the alumni of the alumni of the alumni of the alumni of the alumni of the students in <unk> days after their <unk> .
so that 's rapidly fast .
<unk> percent have already made autonomously .
one third of the donors were <unk> .
and our <unk> is at seven percent .
i 've been told it the <unk> of seven percent is a <unk> in germany .
i 'm a <unk> .
a <unk> costs in <unk> per year , the $ 100 dollars per year .
and it 's a beautiful <unk> , <unk> , which is a span of seven percent of a <unk> percent of a <unk> .
and when my father and i started to have this <unk> , we 're open , we have been open to quite a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a little bit of a lot of <unk> .
i had given my great <unk> in a big company .
but i 've got to tell you , i do n't have to do that in my life , i did n't have a <unk> work .
we encourage our participants to take responsibility .
and responsibility what 's happening in your life and all responsibility for what will happen in your life .
not to hide , nothing else .
because that leads to a whole new self , and it allows you to trust to trust .
and that 's why it makes me very happy and proud of our participants open from her way .
so i brought you a little video here .
film .
so i was <unk> to two years and eight months of dangerous .
i was convicted of the <unk> for <unk> and 10 months .
i traded the magic .
so , i have been getting judgment from two years to be dangerous .
i was <unk> for <unk> and <unk> with <unk> .
so , through my participation in <unk> , actually actually changed my entire life .
and what was important for me , this <unk> that will be done again .
because i was my absolute <unk> .
i was not <unk> , i 'm almost saying , yes .
i 've got goals again .
i came back to the next point of view , i came back to the front page .
and you go from a very different mind and confidence from the prison .
and so far , more and more <unk> , and then you have a fixed goals , and then you 're going to go back into something .
so with the wrong people , and it does n't do it .
well , the problem is , many of them do n't have a <unk> , if the ones .
the biggest problem , because it 's automatically <unk> that you get back into the old <unk> .
you do n't know anything else .
so , through this <unk> individual leader , no sense of individual individual people , which is all going to be a way of thinking about me , about myself , about myself , about other people , about other , about the problem with problems , about with the society , that has completely shot in me as that number of weeks .
i have been in my first wife from a <unk> woman .
and for six months , i 'm going to go back with her together .
so that means we started to have a new relationship .
and because i 've been through this whole , and many other things have changed .
i 've got a lot of a lot .
i 'm in my family again with the education .
so i 'm working in my life today , i say .
i 'm going to leave you to the <unk> .
you really need to acknowledge that there are very , very many people who actually have a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , really , like , my mentor , and actually , of course , to be beyond this time , and actually , i do n't know , <unk> engagement .
and i 'm thankful to be grateful that you have to have that idea .
and i 'm grateful that you have trouble with trouble , and i 'm extremely thankful to be part of it .
of course , of course , all the people who are support that were the whole , of course .
i 've spoken with many people talking to the events , and again , that 's all the <unk> that 's good .
and that 's what i 'm going to do .
and thank you .
come to prison .
all of them has something we need .
if you put our participants on their <unk> , if you 're in your <unk> , if you 're in a funding , you 're in a financial support .
if you 're going to wear our program into a new <unk> , really <unk> .
let 's talk about .
martin marbou and i are here today .
and let 's look at the conversation with you .
thank you very much .
so , i 've got <unk> at <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> in nepal .
in a time i was a <unk> <unk> .
there 's things like that .
for example .
the <unk> .
take a <unk> of the <unk> .
there are really many ways that you can deal with a lot of ways that you can deal with .
so , even how to deal with <unk> .
but i was also <unk> .
so with my work , and so little , with the <unk> .
and i really need to talk about <unk> .
and not from real problems .
my problem was , i was <unk> , and i could do pretty much like my life will look at 10 20 years .
it was <unk> .
and this <unk> , i thought , frightening .
to express it <unk> .
basically , i had a <unk> <unk> .
professionally , like private .
i just did n't want to continue to continue ?
just do i think about it ?
or what if i put my <unk> again ?
and look at what happens .
what i 'm waiting for .
that was the idea .
i was free of <unk> <unk> in this time .
it 's like <unk> .
well , the <unk> was for me , despite the absolute big bang .
you 'd be able to move to free for the world living in very good places and <unk> the country in a very <unk> way .
but they were also very sensitive to very poor countries .
in the developing world , developing countries where there 's certainly to see more than <unk> villages with <unk> <unk> people who do n't have nothing , so much happiness .
right from these images and <unk> , but also a <unk> , in a way .
and that was the key for a while .
i was the thing i did .
to <unk> .
and also , i found it a little bit of <unk> to write a country about a country i actually do n't know .
i wanted to change that .
i wanted to know , countries .
to writing <unk> article .
and to quiet my personal interest .
how do you learn to know countries better ?
by using the people .
there are people at home .
not in the hotel .
by seeking the challenges and the issues of human beings .
and by using the people .
at least , the answer that i could give to this question .
and that 's what i wanted to do .
and i wanted to do something meaningful .
i wanted to do a focus .
something good doing .
and this feeling has continued to me with a <unk> <unk> .
i 've been in the world , but i was just particularly touched in the developing world .
until <unk> , there was a <unk> civil civil war that has n't only been able to distinguish many economic and social problems .
with an annual income per capita selling euros , nepal is the poorest country in south asia .
and count , continue to one of the 20 countries around the world .
a quarter of the population lives below the poverty line .
almost one fifth of the population is suffering of malnutrition .
forty percent of adults can not read and writing .
all of these facts are connected with a lot of personal stories and experiences that i met on this journey , and i was ready to be open and open for changes .
i wanted to change something .
and this is what i 've been doing , after all , was my decision .
i quit my job .
and she applied to aid .
and i 'm going to be suggesting a excerpt of the answer that i put on my job application .
because they were just a <unk> .
it 's about an serious job application with <unk> international .
and not to have a <unk> for a <unk> trip that has to live in nepal , and a funding of her <unk> .
hi ?
is it still ?
i mean , my work was really serious .
at least , i thought .
and this answer was a <unk> <unk> .
i was really <unk> .
and , of course , you know , immediately , an emotional answer .
and fortunately , never <unk> .
instead , i 've been looking at this rather intense sense of doing what good <unk> .
i used it as a motor to set my own company .
<unk> .
heart <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
so , a company that basically offers is what i looked at .
and that is the way to get a country different .
the possibility to be really aware of a country .
by being living with people living and work .
and that 's not anywhere , but in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , you can take two words in the way .
so karma and <unk> .
that means so much as a good karma can collect good karma .
you can do good .
now , this sounds <unk> <unk> .
but it 's not .
<unk> is a social <unk> business .
we use tourism as a tool for sustainable development .
and in other words , we use <unk> as a tool for sustainable development .
so <unk> , voice and tourism .
because the people who travel with us as we travel in , for their rescue .
you pay for your journey like a different organizers .
but they just travel different .
they live in <unk> .
and the principle objective is not a lot of care , or much of the way , it 's a lot of a lot of things in terms of time .
social engagement .
and <unk> .
and our participants have ever been moving to <unk> and interests in different projects .
we can increase in our work for a <unk> tourism in areas , if you have no chance of classic tourism .
because just the infrastructure are lacking .
to another , we can increase sustainable projects .
we can start making sustainable projects .
so we fund ourselves to 100 percent .
not rely on donations .
and that 's what we 're doing with our long term and commitment to the importance of meaning .
so we started with our work in nepal .
<unk> year we have our engagement on uganda .
and now after over four years , i turned to get married and my husband , and i also are a team in a way of a way .
so let 's go away the intensity of the air ?
or what if we had more bigger ?
now , if we go back to the <unk> ?
now , when we do n't just create social engagement and sustainable travel , but we grasp development in its wholeness ?
and with the individual <unk> ?
or i think , else 's special individual <unk> .
that would be a new company .
a company that manages to company .
with other <unk> , but the same philosophy of <unk> .
do we want to do that ?
one was the next question .
<unk> new businesses ?
we 're sure to do that .
we love entrepreneurs and their creative company .
because we 're right now .
because we talk the same language .
because we dream the same dreams .
because we understand the challenges .
and that 's why we have given a sister in this year .
<unk> .
and with <unk> , we make creative companies in their development and <unk> <unk> that we are supportive by really powerful people .
so what we call participants , entrepreneurs or employees of creative businesses <unk> with individual development .
so , <unk> <unk> the personal social and <unk> evolution of <unk> .
and they 'd be able to prepare for the <unk> .
there 's also over <unk> .
and one of the use of what 's going to be able to do next to a meaningful gap here .
he shows you in a short short time where you 're in a relatively short time , or where you 're going to do .
where you may be still <unk> .
where you may be flexible in terms of flexibility in thinking .
and he shows you what you 're really good at .
it 's got a strength of eyes .
it 's the creativity that suddenly has been great .
or it 's like the serenity you found in the way .
the serenity things you do n't want to do with you .
and the force , things to change that you can change .
and you can change very much .
well , in a short short time .
we know that .
one example .
these are <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
this is five very wonderful women from uganda .
with sad <unk> and talent .
it 's <unk> beautiful , <unk> <unk> .
and there 's nothing .
because they just had no market .
because they did n't know how to improve the quality .
because nobody said that design may be coming in .
we wanted to help these women .
and that 's why the year is also a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
products get out of poverty .
they give them a income .
there 's a future .
we went back yesterday with our <unk> live .
and we start with a <unk> <unk> .
a <unk> <unk> of thousand <unk> from our women .
the sale is not just a income for a year .
it also allows us to make the project still more bigger .
now , this first <unk> is basically social resilience and <unk> in one .
so who wants to support , can be able to take this to one of the arteries , but he can travel directly to the project .
he can travel to women and actively actively actively .
in the long time , we do n't want to give a five women a work , but we do n't want to take a hundred or a hundred .
and it 's not just in uganda , but also in nepal , and in other <unk> that we work in .
but this <unk> is just a project from our integrated cycle of projects .
we work in all the central areas .
in <unk> , <unk> and health and <unk> and <unk> .
because the work is just too little .
what happens when the women work ?
right .
that 's why we started in every year in nepal , and in uganda , in uganda , we 've got two <unk> centre .
it 's <unk> in our cycle .
and this is more sense more than every single project .
and participants are coming to <unk> in the different projects .
and the result of the way , they 're always just in the shared work .
and to finish , i want to take you right now .
and i ask you to close the eyes .
imagine you 're in africa .
in the rural heart of uganda .
you 're sitting on a wooden dining room .
and i 'm sick and sick of them .
you 've just eaten with your <unk> .
there was <unk> .
<unk> .
tasty .
the walls are <unk> .
here 's it inside , it 's forced warm .
you get off the window .
and look at <unk> <unk> .
their <unk> feet <unk> the sand .
you <unk> your <unk> .
it 's also a thin layer of <unk> .
the kids laugh .
you call your name for fun .
you know you do n't think you 're not just <unk> you .
<unk> .
you do n't know how late it is .
but soon you will get up .
and the <unk> , on the moment , the kids were coming up , <unk> .
the end of the street is a big tree .
you 're going to meet you with <unk> .
in the nanoscale , sit in the shadow of the tree will be going to discuss the new designs .
you 'll always talk to your hands and feet .
later the other women are coming in .
they smile .
you know till you do with your english classroom .
under the tree .
in free .
amazing that there are internet here .
tomorrow you go back with your coach .
that 's what you want to do .
the exchange is valuable .
and again , it 's pretty much to talk about german .
you <unk> music .
and the <unk> of <unk> .
mum <unk> <unk> in the courtyard .
she sings a african song .
you are comfortable and happy .
you can do the eyes again .
each one of us can be able to make sense of something new .
or at least , for a short time , the cube again .
and look at what happens .
thank you .
before i 'm going to start , i would be interested in , you know , from you now , you know , you know , you know , you 've got somebody else 's house here .
i do n't know , `` i do n't know , '' not so good , but maybe somebody wants to raise your hand hand .
here 's a little bit of <unk> .
two .
now , here 's not the point here , i 'm sorry , but at every case , there are two , that 's beautiful , we 're here .
i also had a building in the east of it , which is the <unk> mountain of the city ,
that 's the building .
together with 20 other people , i put it back in the last summer six months .
and that 's why i 'm standing here tonight .
well , maybe some of you may be say .
what is it ?
<unk> are many .
but i want to explain it quickly .
oh , what do you get the <unk> ?
and you go back to the park , or how ?
just a little selection of questions that <unk> us , friends , colleagues , as you have learned that i 'm going to be part of a initiative that i 'm going to be <unk> with .
and all of all the time we had turned into the face of <unk> <unk> .
and here , about these <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and to belong against the privatization of these <unk> .
but who knows me , that 's not my kind of <unk> .
and it was not the elected <unk> of the initiative .
what we see here is a sign from the <unk> show in <unk> .
this is a public space that is private , and it 's not available for many people to say , not to say , not to say , but i 'm not going to be used in the public hand , and you can not use public spaces .
we were a group of <unk> groups in the desire to be <unk> with <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
and we wanted to tell another <unk> .
we were a very serious team , and this is a very short team , because it was a very serious team .
from the areas of architecture , urban social -- politics -- and <unk> <unk> , statistics , design , music , photography , <unk> and <unk> .
of course , also , with different social cultural cultural and personal <unk> .
our perspectives .
and we can allow us to be able to allow us to be different , but also on different networks .
and creative , <unk> solutions in the <unk> that we have done with the <unk> .
we actually have to seat the <unk> .
however , we went on with stories and ideas .
we asked memory and images .
and these memories and images trying to develop different perspectives perspectives .
it 's the important thing that the process has always been <unk> .
as an initiative , we have always been sensitive to this as a <unk> platform , as a <unk> .
so , <unk> was a <unk> and emotional faces and became a <unk> .
and the experience that we 've done with that , i 'm going to go through here tonight .
every city has <unk> places .
there 's a face .
and in many cases , these <unk> and <unk> , and will be seen as a result of citizens as strangers .
they are the dead places of a city because they do n't often be the equivalent of what we expect in a public space .
so for example , we have <unk> .
now , they 're going to be a public , public places , will be neglected , will be a lot of <unk> .
initiatives that want to revive places like these places , remain frequently <unk> interest in the infancy .
so , what has it to do with me , like some questions , a few questions like this .
i mean , a lot .
these places are not just a face .
no .
and they 're the social places of our city in which our <unk> lives .
so that 's how we have to do with our neighbors to our neighbors , when we happen to the local way to the store .
and can this dive into the way that we have a best way to sit up , and actually stop us to stop when the spaces are designed for it .
and we 're just going to get longer smarter .
they come out of these things , sometimes .
but what 's certainly is a sense of community .
the more encounters i get in this public space , the the faster and the more you create this community .
and if i do n't <unk> , then what you 're going to do is what you 're going to be a big city .
we then stood up two challenges .
we can make awareness in the citizens of the citizens , responsibility and engagement for their neighborhoods or be able to be <unk> .
what can protest be transformed in creation ?
how can a critique of ideas are transformed ?
protest against the privatization and <unk> of these <unk> areas and criticism against the civil war and criticism against the civil war , and actually not even understood the same way .
so imagine you 're sitting here , you 're going to beat the newspaper and read next text .
love <unk> and citizens , we want to store it , and we want to show you three sorts of options for the <unk> of the <unk> that 's been designed a before carefully <unk> <unk> .
you 're allowed to chose a flavor of the idea .
and the flavor with most of the <unk> will be done .
would you go ?
would anyone like you to this event ?
probably not .
why not ?
i mean , it 's been great .
there 's a real way of doing what 's going on .
you can be able to figure out how it looks like in the future .
and as i say , it 's been a great moment .
i 'm going to attempt in a explanation .
and that , because i think i 'm not going to be able to suggest that you 're not really supposed to be a conversation or you are participating , or participating .
one , because classical <unk> are often very late .
that means , mostly they do n't have a chance to do , really , really own subjects , or to discuss the basic alternative , but there 's actually actually <unk> design , and you can still decide if you 're <unk> or <unk> in the city of plants .
or , like a friend recently , the color of the <unk> would have <unk> for example .
second explanation , classic <unk> is rarely <unk> about information and voting .
think about the three <unk> varieties .
we have here what we want to show you , and you have to vote .
frustration and <unk> are often the consequences of what i think i sort of think that i sort of think .
i mean , i do n't want to make a decision about <unk> or <unk> , if i 'd like to have <unk> <unk> instead of <unk> .
but it 's also different .
although the <unk> of the genetic data has been a lot of conversations , we have had a lot of <unk> experience .
and we were picked up and i want to share that , and i want to share that to other <unk> .
i want to convey it to other initiatives , other projects , but all of the city or the city and the politics .
because those are the ones who are doing these things that are actually doing these things that are actually doing that , and they are actually responsible for these processes .
when really , really , really , interested in the interest is how many people are doing , how many people are doing , we need to acknowledge , and then we need the new <unk> .
but i do n't even know what i 'm going to do , but also , i 'm all about you all the ones you 're sitting here today .
and that 's why , because i 'm important for very important .
i think it 's important for all of you all , and i want to encourage you to give you a chance to be a chance .
and i 'm looking at them all , because they are the ones that can be able to take a new <unk> .
so what we need to look like , we need to look at the citizens of citizens , responsibility and engagement for their neighborhoods and feeling for participation and sticks .
first of all , willingness to <unk> .
in <unk> , professionals in <unk> , citizens in <unk> and different interests each other .
so what we see here is a bench that we invited .
and what we see here are some <unk> and <unk> in the conversation with citizens .
the goal has to be that all of these conversations on <unk> , so that not the <unk> interests or the <unk> <unk> of the citizens of citizens .
and the citizen in place are experts , they are experts for their neighborhood , they know what they 're lacking to connect with a place where tradition is a place and what 's missing in the place .
the <unk> , especially in the city , can do what to be able to be able to be an idea .
and in a particular case , in a particular case , another <unk> will be able to add the topics that are focused on the project , depending after .
and this is all going to be a <unk> where all information is to be accessible to all of the information for all of all the information and then will be <unk> .
perhaps , maybe can be able to receive a message that allowed an identification of the place .
there 's a dialogue that means also that the wishes of the farmers are actually getting seriously .
and if somebody says , i want to say , i want to be a <unk> next to the <unk> .
and that can be complete <unk> , but the goal has to be in <unk> , with all of the things , which is the right solution , and maybe maybe it 's also going to fill the <unk>
it 's like , that 's what i 've got to do .
second point are different up .
our <unk> is colorful .
one feels completely comfortable when he can talk about <unk> big group .
well , another one can be able to do well , but the text is not going to talk about <unk> <unk> .
one of the other ones may be rather rather than <unk> .
or build his ideas in <unk> <unk> .
what i want to say , it needs to be different <unk> to be <unk> different groups .
so , for example , we 've got the opportunity to be able to get there , just watch what happens .
in the background , little exhibition .
we had had the opportunity to give up here .
we had had the opportunity to paint .
we had had the opportunity to write .
it 's independent .
that was a girl 's girl .
we had a chance to connect our ideas with play ideas .
also , the ability to engage outside of <unk> are still supposed to be forever .
so , for example , this can happen about a <unk> that can happen about <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> and transparent availability of the result of the result of the quad .
we have <unk> the whole process of facebook on facebook , and on one of them you have independent blog , and at the same time , news <unk> <unk> over a <unk> .
our third point is <unk> .
you may remember that i said that maybe i was going to be a late period of time .
in my <unk> event , they were already three finished <unk> .
but <unk> is just the process , but it 's going to be working early , and i do n't even know what 's going to happen in the best way .
so , if you have this dialogue , and with that , i 'm going to have a little bit of one , which is where scenarios are coming in .
<unk> is also about <unk> , by the way .
and then , if not from the beginning , that the <unk> event is so looking like this , but looking at the experience of the previous <unk> .
so what happens when citizens are coming up with their city , their city .
is already in many projects .
i 've got an example of <unk> , which is the <unk> , is probably known at many here .
in new york , a project was launched a project .
in <unk> circles , there 's been <unk> dollars in six weeks , they have to do the funding for funding or at least <unk> .
now , the time in august , in august , in august , in august , in august , in august , was n't unlike the idea of their own .
also , the <unk> in new york , to whom i do n't have to say , because he has become one of the most important <unk> of the city , no idea of politics or administration .
the opposite , the <unk> for the <unk> .
in <unk> , with us , we 're back back in germany , the citizens in germany are already <unk> plans again .
the city was not needed .
and the four weeks of <unk> that we have been hearing for <unk> , the wealthy .
now , this is the <unk> of the city .
while the page is doing a little bit wonderful , and the city of <unk> is the city , which has been the initiative that started in , and other <unk> .
in the other hand , they <unk> their own <unk> on the street .
in rotterdam , there was a <unk> <unk> .
all right , so far , you want to say .
and then we just do now .
but i think it 's wrong the city of responsibility .
why ?
you say , because you should have a look for it .
as the dedicated , it 's citizen initiatives , or businesses , in a rule of <unk> focus in any form , the city 's responsibility for projects that are also on the edge of attention .
and to the other , of course , if the city has <unk> , other resources are there .
a <unk> initiative can be sent back to the <unk> .
it 's also a temporary initiative that was a temporary initiative for their work was about a year to take the results of the city , and the responsibility of the city .
now , current state , a <unk> has bought the <unk> in january .
there are plenty of negotiation .
so , unfortunately , we have the problem that we could not be able to take the responsibility .
but we know that in fact now , if the city are successful , if the negotiations are successful , if the negotiations are actually successful , that it will be successful .
what 's happening is not open .
to finish , i 'm convinced that many projects , that 's because of their importance , complexity or the cost of the city , have a chance to produce happiness .
if you 're just going to be in time in the future .
in each other and citizens .
in each of the city , and all of them you are sitting here tonight .
if we 're going to demand our job , and at the same time , the policymakers does n't see the <unk> of the citizens on the citizens , but as a <unk> .
that 's it .
yesterday , we were in <unk> here in the <unk> islands , and we 're coming into the <unk> .
we talked about <unk> .
so this idea , this idea , is still the second chance of thinking , if it was n't working in this life , it 's just <unk> the second opportunity .
so , we found that really exciting .
and we were relatively quickly to agree that there are two things that we do n't want to experience .
this is the puberty .
the second one was immediately working on the table at school ?
no way .
no way .
school , some of you may remember <unk> .
it 's so , for me , this is now <unk> years ago , but the words are going to go up immediately .
and my neck <unk> together , and i just want to leave back to it .
and then i do n't know how to tell you , but in my review , i was always going to have the <unk> of the <unk> seriously , who was sitting next to me .
i do n't know what became the way that was actually going to be .
so you will understand it , my school , my school was really beautiful , and after i had my last <unk> behind me , it was totally clear , never back .
and what 's going to say i 'm going to say , if i spent a few of the nicest days that i spent in schools .
with great desire and entirely voluntary .
so how did it come ?
how could this happen ?
it just started that something happened in the way i could n't calculate .
i got children .
so my wife got children .
and that 's why it was clear that it 's a one that had to care about this <unk> .
until one day , when she said , `` it 's <unk> . ''
and today you go .
yes , <unk> .
i opened the door , and then i was sitting in this <unk> and <unk> , i felt <unk> into the <unk> .
this is exactly what it looked like at the time .
and also , like school , like school , <unk> , and i 'm going to be able to feel like this , i mean , this is a real failure .
and when i heard the teacher , and you know , you know , you know , you know , kids do n't learn to school for school , but for my god , i said , `` oh , my god , '' i did n't know . ''
so what 's what we 've been looking at school , from the school school , i 'm really going to have really picked out of this .
so many of us have learned very well .
where do they actually have to be able to convert it into your lifetime of life ?
and maybe some even still know how the capital of yugoslavia is .
what is yugoslavia ?
or <unk> , this ability to be a lot of knowledge in a very short time in a short time , just about <unk> , just so i can leave it back to a little bit of <unk> before me .
well , i used to have all the time for the <unk> , but otherwise ?
and what 's a <unk> from a point one point one point about that somebody 's going to be a good doctor ?
if the <unk> is , if the good amount of <unk> qualities ?
no way .
so , no way , no way of life , we do n't learn for school .
if we look like this , about <unk> years , the middle of the century century , there is yes .
this is the time in the germany , in germany , in the germany , it 's been fully fully introduced in the ground .
and where the school system , how we have today , its roots has its roots .
and if we imagine time at the time , it was actually so that people who had no access to the knowledge of their time .
and there were these four or six years that they were forced to go to school in school , and they were <unk> with knowledge that were actually the only way that they had had to come to knowledge and the facts and the information of their time .
today , a <unk> is more information in its pocket than the largest library of the day .
and the middle of the century , that was the <unk> of the <unk> .
that means a lot of change has changed in the world , and there 's a lot of people who could exploit this new machines .
but at the same time , but also people needed to wait these machines and repair them .
and we needed people who could build these machines , and they could build these factories .
maybe you see it .
the <unk> school system that we have still have in germany today , has its root in this time .
and there may be sense .
and i mean , because it 's probably probably the way that i 've been trained in school that i 've been doing in school , i 've been doing it in school , in the assembly line , who was in the assembly line of the assembly line , who was there at the assembly line , who was there .
let 's make a look at the future .
let 's take the <unk> century where it is , and look at the year .
the year was the year , the year was the year that was the first <unk> moment to go back to the year .
and i was done with my studying , and i thought , now , you know , now , you see , now , you 're parked you on , the first company .
yes , after some of me all around the internet , then i 'm going to be <unk> .
and some of them are getting around us , and we have been bigger and bigger and more and bigger and we have been bigger , and we 're still very slow , and some of the businesses are so much in <unk> <unk> .
you 're always seeing in life .
and we then had <unk> <unk> .
so , we had this beautiful growth , and we had so exciting all the exciting professions , like <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
i do n't know if you have a <unk> idea of what these people are doing , but when i went to school , we had no idea that it would be ever going .
even when i was <unk> , i was not talking about the internet .
and the kids that we send in school today , what do you get ?
the only honest answer is that we have no idea .
and what facts are going to have to be successful in these future jobs ?
and if you 're honest , there 's the only answer , we have no idea .
and because we 're looking at the future , who could give me the <unk> for the saturday .
there 's <unk> <unk> , i read .
well , you see , you have no idea .
how do we get out what 's going to do for school life ?
what are the things that we need to fit for children for life ?
and maybe look at what companies are looking for people to pay today .
that 's the <unk> of school , yes ?
the alumni of schools and universities are coming into the company .
and if you look like this , you know , classical <unk> looks like this , you know , you know , there 's a first thing to be here , yes , like the expertise .
so , you want to be , so you 're going to read , so we 're going to look at the read of this , we 're looking at <unk> <unk> <unk> and twelve years ago .
it 's not going to be school in the future .
but in fact , what could possibly afford to be the things that are always important , and i 'm convinced that these <unk> <unk> will be the <unk> <unk> of the future .
and you can conclude in three groups .
so , that 's for one , companies want to employees that are flexibly , so flexibility is one .
now , almost all the businesses want to think of <unk> .
and then these companies are hiring .
so we have <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
let 's start with flexibility .
that is relatively fast .
if we look at how economies works today , how quickly is how quickly it changes .
<unk> , all the business models are going to be put on the internet today on tomorrow .
so there 's a need to have a need .
i have a need .
i have <unk> .
that 's pretty much the opposite of what was going on in the end of the late century of employees on the assembly line .
now , the second issue of thinking is relatively clear .
it 's about responsibility .
there is people who take responsibility .
first of all , for yourself and their own life .
but also , for the great whole whole .
now , if this is the company , or as society , we want to take people a responsibility for the big whole .
and the third factor , the <unk> , which will almost be close to the most frequently .
and if we remember the football , then there was this beautiful saying .
argentina has <unk> <unk> portugal , and germany has a team .
it was not urgent <unk> that won the <unk> .
they could only get that together together .
and somebody , this great innovator of our time , steve jobs , yes , <unk> .
it was n't the guy who invented the iphone , which did n't invent the <unk> , who did n't invent why has nothing happened .
this had a team that has been able to do that , because just as a team that you could have done what they did .
so <unk> <unk> that could convey these three things that could be sent to the school that we have to learn for .
but there 's still <unk> fourth point and that 's really more important .
and that 's the learning .
if the only thing we can say about the future of the future with security is that it 's not the ability to learn new and fun of this learning thing that we are doing in the future , and that our children are successful in the future .
i mean , in fact , with school math , which shows these things .
but where was i ?
i was sitting in this <unk> , and those of them who know you know , who knows that this is not a <unk> event that you need to pay attention to .
so the event , the event after the slogan , but it 's not even said of everyone .
except to the moment , where <unk> will be elected , suddenly , all invisible .
yes , i was sitting there and i want to say , when i 'm going to say , the <unk> of one of my children were these <unk> , the <unk> parts of the event .
it was less fun for me as a dad when this stress about the topic of homework and learning all the entire life life .
and even less fun , if the child gets sick , because in school , is stress <unk> .
and eventually , this <unk> , or was a peak of these <unk> in this school .
in fact , it was not a <unk> , so it was a <unk> , so directly after the last hour and in fact , also the only parents were invited .
and i 'm going to talk to you now , and i 'm going to tell you the details of the moment when we have to acknowledge our child .
but <unk> are two years in which we see , where we have noticed , it does n't work .
so , what do we actually do ?
and we were actually asking the question of our child ?
and are we the only ones that it goes like ?
now , i 've been talking about the last two years , since i 've spoken in the topic of research with very many people , and i realized , i 've been learned that i 'm not alone .
well , there 's a lot of that , there 's a very similar way , and that was like this , and that was two years ago , and that 's been two years ago , and that 's where i was going to think about `` <unk> , '' we 've just been building a new company , a new company , have been thinking about where the journey goes there .
and what i want to say , he 's just told me the same story with one of his children , he 's almost seen the same same thing as we , and we had the happiness that we could take our children from school , yes ?
in berlin , there 's a company called <unk> <unk> , and we could do private companies .
but can everybody out there ?
and somehow , it was a little bit of just the way to get our children in security and to leave these <unk> out there to be there .
and after we have both been the idea of now , in school , since we had n't been able to change it , well , we thought , well , we 're the first ones who are now doing this .
just , how do we change something like a <unk> ?
the good thing is that we deceived us .
we 're not alone .
but we found relatively fast , we have been relatively fast , a lot of amazing people who wanted to do , which is what we wanted to do , which is , to work , to school , to school , to school , to work on .
it 's not so that only the children and their parents are under the suffering , which is there very often .
if we look at the teachers , 30 percent of teachers have <unk> .
if we look at us , as the number of evidence has changed in the last 10 years .
can it be now that all the parents do ?
that all children are broken and that the teachers are broken ?
or can it be that we have a <unk> school system that simply does n't fit anymore , like this <unk> of <unk> years ago , that just does n't matter so .
and we found many people that went alike and we found even people who do n't have children .
and they realized that you have to take responsibility for the future that you have to take responsibility for the future , by taking responsibility for the future that we have to do with our children and children that are going to go to school .
and we 've got <unk> in <unk> second , there 's a whole bunch of amazing initiatives that want to change school , and there are <unk> schools , here , and there 's really great <unk> , and there 's almost lunch , and there 's almost lunch that want to change and want to change .
and there 's even one or another bold principal that will be able to go to the first step .
and how do we help help ?
we did n't have a concept that we could help over now .
but we can do one thing , we can go into these schools , and we can do in these schools , the people who love school , so the parents , the teachers and the students , and we can do with two days .
so there are people that come together in the past that have more due to the past , and learn how to work in two days .
they come out with a very concrete challenge that they solve together .
and after two days , then they 've been developed a new paradigm or the <unk> , i have been given to talk to a complete new high high high high high high high high high high school as we 're going to be trained in a berlin school .
or they have concrete things for <unk> problems that they have in their school .
within two days together , new ones that can be realized at the next day .
but what 's the most important thing is , what happens to these two days , and it makes it so much the little weekends that i 've been to spend in a germany , then this energy that happens when the three things are going to learn .
and if you have three things in common , which is like flexibility .
so basically <unk> , and if you experience a team .
this is a piece of a piece of a piece of <unk> .
and if we got four weeks after this <unk> workshop to work back to school , we know that the school started to change that there was a whole new culture .
and this is incredibly <unk> .
and i 'm going to invite you to think about school .
i invite you to think of school .
and i invite you to talk about school , about school .
talk about what you like , but talk about what you do n't like .
you 're going to be surprised how much <unk> you get and how many people have seen the same , but just not talk about it .
let 's get every single school in germany in germany .
let 's change the entire education system .
and let 's do that , together , with the people with school day for the school day , with the parents , the teachers and students .
because in common , we can do that .
thank you .
