when steve lopez , the los angeles times , one day one day went through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , a <unk> , <unk> , rough , homeless , who was playing on a violin that had just two strings .
many of them will recognize the story , because from <unk> article about this , later a book , which was <unk> <unk> , with robert <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , who was left at the <unk> , and whose promising career was finished by his <unk> schizophrenia .
<unk> left <unk> , had a <unk> , and 30 years later , he lived in the streets of <unk> church in the center of los angeles .
i 'm going to recommend all of you , <unk> book , looking at the film that 's not just the wonderful interconnectedness between these two men , but also how the music helped make this connection and how they can get the instrument that this pun is to get the way that the pun
i met mr <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , two years ago , from walt disney hall .
he 'd just heard a video from <unk> first and fourth symphony , and came up behind the stage to imagine me .
he was talking about a very <unk> and <unk> sound of yo-yo ma and hillary clinton , and how the dodgers never would be in the baseball series , and that 's all about the first <unk> of the first violin in the last sentence of <unk> <unk> .
we came to talk to the topic of music , and a couple of days later , i got an email , in the state that 's been interested in interest with me .
i still have to mention that <unk> had a medical treatment , because he was already been treated with <unk> and <unk> , a trauma that has his whole life .
and as a result of this , he 's now susceptible to these <unk> phases , and these are sometimes bad , and he disappears awake in the streets of <unk> , and he 's exposed to the <unk> of his own mind .
and in exactly a <unk> , <unk> was when we started to visit our first <unk> in walt <unk> . he had this <unk> <unk> in his eyes and was completely lost .
he was talking about invisible demons and smoke , and about how to poison somebody in the sleep .
i did n't think of fear , but i was afraid that i could lose him in one of his states , and that i could destroy his relationship to violin , when i started to talk about <unk> and <unk> and other exciting forms of <unk>
so i just started to play .
i used the first sentence of <unk> <unk> .
and as i used , i realized that in <unk> eyes were a complete change in <unk> .
it was as if he stood under the impact of an invisible food , a chemical response , which was my game .
<unk> <unk> anger turned into understanding of a quiet curiosity and <unk> .
and as through a miracle , he took his violin , and started to play some clips from <unk> , and i asked me to play her , <unk> , <unk> .
we then started talking about music , starting from stream over beethoven , <unk> , <unk> and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> .
and i realized that he had not just a <unk> knowledge of music , but it 's also a huge personal relationship with them .
he was talking to a passion and a understanding that i 'd just know about my colleagues in <unk> .
by playing music , and talking about music , from this <unk> , confused man , who was decided to go through the streets of los angeles .
music is medicine . music is changing us .
for <unk> , music means <unk> health .
because the music allows him to be his thoughts and delusions with the help of his imagination and creativity in a way .
and so he <unk> his <unk> states .
i realized that this is the nature of art .
now , this is the reason why we do music : so that we can do something that is something that is in all of us in the inner way , our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our artistic lens , through our creativity , through our creativity .
and the reality of that comes to us all , and moves , we 're inspired .
so , what <unk> <unk> , so the music got back to a community of friends .
the <unk> force of music brought him back into a family of musicians that understood him that had his talent and began exploring him .
and i 'm going to talk about <unk> music , no way in the walt disney <unk> hall or in <unk> row , because he reminds me why i am musician .
thank you very much .
bruno giussani : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i have stolen the <unk> .
i hope you excuse me .
so i know many fish in my life .
i only loved two .
this first , that was more like a passionate <unk> .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good things , <unk> , a <unk> on the menu .
what a fish .
more and better , he was brought to the highest standards of sustainability .
so you could be able to think of it .
i had a relationship with this beauty about several months .
one day , the ceo 's head call the company , and asked if i could tell me about an event of sustainability .
`` of course , '' i said .
here was a company that tried to solve what was this incredible problem to our chefs . how do we keep fish on our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years , we have <unk> the oceans like we <unk> forests .
it 's hard to <unk> the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , you have collapsed .
it 's almost nothing left .
so it 's probably going to be or evil , <unk> , a part of our future .
many arguments in the case of doing this , <unk> pollute the environment , most of them , and they are inefficient , we take tuna . a great <unk> .
he 's got a <unk> from 15 .
that means , 15 pounds need to take a pound of <unk> .
not very sustainable .
not very well .
so here was finally a company that tried to do it right .
i wanted to supported them .
the day before the event , i called the head of <unk> for the company .
so let 's call it clear .
`` i mean , `` well , '' i said , `` just to have the facts right , you 're famous to be famous in the oceans that you do n't add the environment . ''
`` it 's true , '' he said , `` we are so far out that the waste of our fish are distributed , ''
and then he would add , `` we 're basically a real world .
this <unk> of <unk> to one , he said .
`` the best in the industry . ''
<unk> to one , great .
`` <unk> to one of what ? what do you do ? ''
`` sustainable proteins '' he said .
`` great , '' i said .
and that night i was in bed , and i thought , what to hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , short of the event , , i call it .
and i said , `` well , what for example are sustainable proteins ? ''
he said , he does n't know that . he will be asking .
now , i 'm <unk> with a couple of people in the company . nobody could give me a <unk> answer .
and we also call it <unk> .
and i said , `` well , '' i said , `` what to sustainable proteins ? ''
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , `` huh ? ''
he said , `` yes , feathers , skin , <unk> , pennsylvania , <unk> and too . ''
i said , `` how much percent of <unk> is chicken ? ''
in the adoption , maybe two percent .
`` well , that 's about 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , `` yeah , what is sustainable to feed chicken ? ''
there were a long break in the line , and he said , `` there are just too much chicken on the world . ''
i 'm going to pull out of this fish .
no , not because i 'm a <unk> and <unk> .
this is me .
no , i actually actually <unk> <unk> from this fish , because i swear to god , who has been fish after this conversation .
this second fish , that 's a different kind of <unk> .
it 's the romantic way of romantic , the way you have to know you know , you know , you know , you know , the more you know , the more loves .
i was eating him in a restaurant in <unk> .
an <unk> journalist had been talking about this fish .
it 's sort of <unk> .
he came up with the table with a bright , almost <unk> white color .
the chef had <unk> him .
twice .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can keep a fish so taste after he was <unk> ?
i ca n't , but this guy can .
i call it miguel . actually is miguel .
and no , he does n't have the fish , and he 's not a chef . at least on the way that you and i understand them .
he 's a biologist at <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner .
it 's near the <unk> of the river .
to the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of <unk> .
they were <unk> <unk> on what basically the wetlands .
they did this by <unk> the country .
they built this complicated series of canals , and they were coming out water from the country , and out of the river .
well , they could n't say that that was , not economically .
and <unk> is a catastrophe .
it 's about 90 percent of birds around the birds for these places for these places .
and so 1982 , a spanish company bought the country .
what did they do ?
they have the river of water the water .
they literally have the dials .
and instead of using the water , they used the channels to <unk> the water again .
they <unk> the channels .
and she created a 11,000 hectares of <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , eel -- and this is where you have <unk> , and his company has largely ecological destruction .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you 've never seen anything .
they 're looking at the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you can see is <unk> channels and these dense , <unk> march .
i was not a long time ago .
he 's a tremendous guy , three parts of charles darwin , and a part of the <unk> . ''
okay ? there were us through the wetlands , and i sat down to my knee , and miguel goes to my knee , and miguel goes into silence .
here he picks up a rare <unk> .
now he 's talking about the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , here he sees a pattern of <unk> that reminds him to the <unk> giraffe .
it turns out , miguel has spent the largest part of his career in <unk> national park .
i asked him how he has become a <unk> .
he said , `` fish ? i do n't know about fish .
i 'm an expert for relationships . ''
and then he goes , and over more talking about rare birds and algae and strange <unk> .
and do n't understand me , that was really fascinating , you know , that 's the <unk> community , so in the way .
it 's great , but i was in love .
and my head became weak about this <unk> piece of <unk> fish that i had on the <unk> .
so i left him out . i said , `` miguel , how do you get your fish so good ? ''
he showed them the algae .
`` i know boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that 's incredible .
but what do you eat ?
how is the <unk> ? ''
now , he 's going to tell me that there 's a <unk> system that the fish eat , what they would eat in the wild .
the vegetable biomass , the phytoplankton , the <unk> , that 's what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it 's completely <unk> .
there 's no food .
the one of a farm is that their animals are not feeding ?
later , every day , i drove up on this site , miguel around me , and i asked him , i said , `` for a place that seems like this , of course , as every farm that i 've ever been . ''
and in the moment , it was like a <unk> had to have a <unk> .
and we 'd like to bow around the corner , and we used to be the most amazing sight , thousands and thousands of <unk> flamingos , a <unk> <unk> of the eye .
`` it 's succeeded , '' he said .
`` look at your heart bag , pink .
they <unk> . ''
<unk> ? i was entirely confused .
i said , `` miguel , do n't you do your fish ? ''
`` yes , '' he said .
`` we 're losing 20 percent of our fish and <unk> on the birds .
now , last year , this number of 600,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
it 's the largest , and one of the most important <unk> will have become all the most important <unk> in europe .
i said , `` miguel , is a good <unk> <unk> that you want to have on a <unk> ? ''
he agreed his head , no .
he said , `` we build <unk> , not extensively .
this is a <unk> network .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
the shrimp ate the phytoplankton .
so , the <unk> , the better <unk> . ''
okay , let 's rethink that . a farm that does n't take your feeding , and a farm which is measuring their success on the health of their health .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and , by the way , this ideology of shoots does n't even be there .
they breed in a city 240 miles away where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
every morning , they travel <unk> miles to the farm .
and you go back to every night , they fly 240 miles back .
they do it because they can follow the white line of <unk> <unk> .
seriously .
i had introduced a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at miguel .
i said , `` miguel , fly up <unk> miles to the farm , and then go back to the evening ?
do you do that for the kids ? ''
and he looked at me as i would have been saying a song from whitney houston .
he said , `` no . they do it because the food is better . ''
i 'm not talking the skin of my beloved fish , the delicious , and i do n't like <unk> . i do n't like <unk> . i do n't like them .
it 's this <unk> , <unk> flavor .
i almost never do .
and yet , when i tried them into this restaurant in <unk> , she did n't have a <unk> .
she liked cute and pure like you would take a bites of the ocean .
i mentioned to miguel , and he <unk> .
he said , `` the skin works like a crazy .
it 's the last resistance , before something goes into the body .
she developed over the course of evolution around evolution . ''
and then he would add , `` but our water has no <unk> . ''
okay . a farm that does n't feed their fish , a farm which is measuring their success .
and then i realized , if he says , a farm that does n't have a farm , he 's got gold , because the water coming out of this farm is coming in .
it 's a river that leads all of all the things with rivers today to lead them , chemical pollutants , <unk> from <unk> .
and when it was fighting through the system , and this leaves is the water clean than how it 's <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it cleans water .
so not just a farm that does not cover her animals , not just a farm which can actually measure their predators on the health of her health of the health of their health , but a farm which is literally a <unk> , and not just for you , but i
because when the water <unk> , it 's <unk> in the atlantic .
you know , a drop of the ocean , but i 'm going to take it , and you should do that , because this <unk> , like romantic is , too .
you could say that you 're a recipe for the future , whether we talk about <unk> or <unk> .
now what we need now is a radical conception of agriculture , from one , of the food actually taste good .
but for many people , it 's a little bit to radically radical .
we 're not <unk> , we 're <unk> . we 're lover .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we 're talking about regional food . we eat organic food .
and if you say that the things are that the future of good food comes somewhere somewhere on and says , `` hey , people , i love pink flamingos , but how will you feed the world ?
how do you feed the world ? ''
can i be honest ?
i do n't like this question .
no , not because we can produce enough calories to feed the world more than just feed .
one billion people are going to be <unk> .
one billion -- that 's more than ever before , because of <unk> inequalities in the distribution , not the <unk> .
well , i do n't like this question , because it 's not the logic of our <unk> , about the last 50 years .
<unk> grain in <unk> , <unk> of <unk> , chemicals on earth , chicken in fish , chicken in fish , chicken in fish , and all of the time is <unk> , `` if we have more people feed food , how awful can that be already ? ''
this was the <unk> . it was the <unk> . it was the business business for american agriculture .
we should call them what she is , a company in <unk> , a company that leads to <unk> capital that can allow that production .
this is not a craft , and it 's not agriculture .
our <unk> is threatened today , not because of <unk> <unk> , but because of <unk> resources .
not through the newest <unk> and <unk> , but through fertile land , not through pumps , but through fresh water , not through chainsaws , not through the forests and networks , but through fish .
you want to feed the world ?
so let 's start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that enable every community to feed themselves ?
to do that , not look at the future for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's done .
capital , chemistry and machines are standing in it , and it never has to be really good for food .
instead , let 's look at the ecological model .
this is that , in two billion years .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
businesses who are not going to be worlds , businesses instead of <unk> , all of the <unk> , can grow up , and they 're <unk> , farmers who are not only <unk> , but experts for relationships .
because they are the ones that are experts for flavor .
and if i 'm really honest , you 're a better chef than i 'm going to be .
you know , that 's right , because if the future is good , it will be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to share with you today , the totality of the data that we 're consuming is larger than the sum of their parts , and instead i want to think that you can think about how to think about how we can use information , and we see
so , what we see here is a typical <unk> <unk> .
so the program i 'm using here is a little experiment .
it 's called <unk> and what i can do with <unk> is that i can filter to a certain cause , we say accidents .
and immediately i see a different pattern that makes me make .
and this is because of the <unk> that people are at the <unk> , and they 're over here .
we can go out of one step out , and then we add the data and see that <unk> and cancer is the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
now , if we 're going to continue on the way , for age , we 're going to say 40 years , or what else we see is that accidents are the leading cause of people who think people should worry about .
and who else sees that is true of men .
so you can see that this is looking at information and data in this way , is reminded of swimming in a living <unk> .
and if we can do this for data , why do n't we do it for content ?
now , what we have here are the <unk> of every single <unk> that have ever been published .
it 's all here . it 's all online .
you 'd like to test it after my talk in your lab .
you can actually get a decade in a decade .
you can jump into a particular year .
you can jump directly to a specific copy .
now , i 'm looking at here , i see the athlete that appear in this copy and <unk> .
i 'm a lance armstrong fan , so i 'll show you the way that i 'm going to show you all in which lance armstrong will be mentioned .
now , if i just want to get a <unk> <unk> , i could think `` ok , what do i look at me on the topic ? ''
so i 'm going to go back and go back the way .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea of that , if you put information on this kind of information , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you do n't just look like ,
you make something that is actually a little different .
it 's something in between and we think it changes the way that information can be used .
i 'd like to do a little bit of doing a little bit bit about what a little bit crazy .
what we 've done here is , we took every single <unk> , and it reduces them on a little summary .
the summary of that is a short <unk> and a symbol for the area that you come from .
i 'm going to show you the top 500 of the <unk> <unk> .
but even in this <unk> view , we can do a lot of things .
so immediately we get a sense of the topics that are on wikipedia .
now , i 'm going to pick up the topic of <unk> .
now , after i chose <unk> , i know that the <unk> that most of the time , most of the time is <unk> `` people of the year . ''
this is really important , because this is a realization that is not in a single <unk> .
it 's just to recognize when you look at one step back and look at it .
<unk> on a certain of these <unk> , i can go into time <unk> `` people of the year . ''
now , if i look at all these individuals , i know that the majority of this are <unk> , some of the science coming from science , some of them are still less , come from the economy , and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , bono is a prize winner .
so we can jump off and look at all the ted prize winner .
you see , we are surfing in the grid , the first time it 's actually really a net , not only about side , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what else is a little surprise .
i 'm going to show you just the new york times website .
now , <unk> , this application -- i do n't want to call it a browser ; it 's not not a browser , but you can look at twitter here -- and we get these <unk> to every single website like this .
so , i can go back one step back and jump into a specific device .
so this is important because you 're just looking at the look at the look at the look at the same way that you can see in this way that can look at the same way .
so i can zoom in my course in a certain period .
here 's the one of the whole demonstration that i thought was that way .
and i can kind of look at what i 've been looking at today , again .
and , if i look back , i can look at it again , i can look at it , i can look at my course , maybe i 'm looking at my same way , and here , i 'm looking for <unk> , here 's what 's going to do .
and from here i can go in the page and go back .
it 's a metaphor that 's used again , and every time it makes it larger than the sum of the <unk> .
right now in this world , we think data is a curse .
we 're talking about the curse of the <unk> .
we 're talking about <unk> in information .
what if we could turn this situation , and then the internet on the head , so , rather than being able to go from one to another , to start to go to many things to many things , and can recognize that otherwise would
if we can do this , this reform will be going to be a new source of <unk> information .
and , rather than moving into information , we can get knowledge .
and if we know that , we can actually get wisdom of this .
with that , thank you very much .
i grew up with a <unk> <unk> of science fiction .
in my school , i <unk> with the bus to school , every single day per day .
and my nose was always in a book , a <unk> that <unk> my thoughts in other worlds , and in <unk> , my deep way of being nervous , <unk> curiosity .
this curiosity , i always showed me , if i was not in school , through the forests , traveled and samples , frogs and snakes and <unk> , all of them took home and looked under the microscope .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and the limitations of the way .
and my love to science fiction seems to be <unk> in my environment , because in the late '60s , we went to the moon .
jacques cousteau came in our living room with his fascinating shows , all of us and places and places , and a world of miracle that we never had had before .
now , that 's actually good at the moment of the <unk> .
and i was artists .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there 's not the video video games nor these <unk> movies nor the entire painting in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
and we had to read that back at the time , when we read a book , we took the description of the <unk> and made them on the canvas in our heads .
my response was to draw and draw from aliens , aliens , worlds , robots and all like that .
in math , i was caught by the teacher , i was caught in the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
the creativity had to get out .
and this was something interesting . which was fascinated by jacques <unk> shows , the idea of a really unknown world on our earth itself .
certainly , i would never have a <unk> world with a spaceship , which seems to be quite unlikely .
but here was a world that i could actually walk in , here on the earth , and she was as fascinating and exotic as all the thing i 've always been imagined when i had read these books .
so i decided to be 15 , scuba diving .
the only problem is that i lived in a little village in canada , 1,000 miles from the next ocean .
but i did n't let me <unk> .
i <unk> my father , until he finally had a <unk> in <unk> , new york , found on the other side of the border where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of <unk> in the middle of <unk> in the winter in <unk> , new york .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i get to face two years later when we moved to california .
since then , in the 40 years that are <unk> now , i spent about three hours of water .
and i learned that the world of the deep ocean , even in the <unk> ocean , in the <unk> ocean , is the realm of <unk> life , as we really ca n't possibly imagine .
nature of nature do n't know borders , especially in our own , <unk> human imagination .
that 's the way that i think about today 's deepest awe of what i see on my <unk> .
and my love to the ocean , with the same intensity , like <unk> and the same .
as a adult , when i was a job , it was the <unk> .
that seemed to be the best way to tell my inner , stories , with my need to create pictures .
as a child , i was doing it all the time .
so , films were films , images and stories .
of course , the stories i 'm going to be <unk> from the <unk> : `` terminator , '' `` aliens , '' and `` <unk> . ''
`` <unk> '' i could connect my <unk> for the <unk> and the origin of the <unk> .
so circles like my two passions .
something interesting happened to `` <unk> '' : to solve a <unk> problem in this film -- and that 's we had to create kind of kind of kind of kind of liquid <unk> -- we had <unk> animation , <unk> .
so , what came out with this is the first <unk> that was ever going to see in a film .
now , the film did n't have a money , and he was just playing his <unk> , but i realized something fascinating : the audience on the world was <unk> from the magic that was <unk> .
according to arthur clarke , we 're the law of understanding technology technology , and it 's not going to be <unk> more .
so they saw something magical .
and that 's what i found that , and i found that .
and i thought , `` wow , that must be to the <unk> . ''
so we went into `` <unk> two , '' my next film , again .
together with <unk> , we created the guy out there from liquid metal . the success was going to get away from this effect .
and it worked , again , we had something magical . and the impact in the audience was the same , but we 've been doing a little bit of the film .
and from these two experiences , was a whole new world , a new world of creativity for <unk> .
so i started a company , together with my good friend of <unk> winston , who was the best <unk> and <unk> . she was called `` digital <unk> . ''
and the idea of this company was to start to start to start to start looking at visual pressure , etc .
and that 's what we did , and we 're going to take an advantage of how an opportunity to be an advantage of that .
but in the middle of the 1990s , we realized that we were in the <unk> and <unk> -- what we had actually started , to slow back to the <unk> .
i had written this piece of avatar , '' which ought to lift the bar in things of visual effects and <unk> effects of <unk> , <unk> effects , <unk> human , fragile characters that were using <unk> , and the <unk> should be <unk> . and the world should be <unk> .
but the bar was very beautiful , and the people in my company said that we 're not supposed to be able to create that .
so i shifted this , and i made this other film about the big ship that goes down .
the <unk> , i 've got this as `` romeo and julia , and julia on a ship , '' it became a <unk> <unk> , a passionate film .
but secretly actually wanted to go to the real wreckage of the titanic .
that 's why i made the film .
this is the truth . the studio did n't know that .
but i convinced you by saying , `` we 're going to dive to the wreckage .
we 're going to show it in the <unk> of the film .
this is hugely important . it 's a good <unk> for marketing . ''
and i <unk> them to pay an expedition .
sound crazy . but this is about again that the own imagination can make a reality .
and then we actually created six months later , in which i found myself in a russian <unk> , four miles under the surface of the north atlantic , and i put the actual titanic through a <unk> .
that was n't the movie , no <unk> , that was real .
so that really blew me .
and the amount of things , we had to build cameras and <unk> and all sorts of things .
and i fell on , like very these <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> planning .
you go up into these capsule , you 're in these dark , hot environment , where no hope is to rescue , if you do n't make it back .
and i thought , `` wow , that 's just as if i was in a <unk> .
that 's really cool . ''
i was really obsessed from studying the deep sea .
anyway , from the part of doing curiosity . it was everything . it was it , it was curiosity .
and it was a experience that could n't give me hollywood .
because you know , i could imagine an creatures that we could make a visual effect , but i could n't imagine what i see outside of the <unk> .
and in some of the following expeditions , i 've seen creatures in <unk> , and sometimes things i 've never seen before , sometimes things that had ever seen even before the science when we saw them , when we saw them
so that 's got me really excited , and i wanted to do more .
and so i then met an unusual decision .
after the success of `` titanic '' i said , `` okay , i want to put my <unk> as a filmmaker in hollywood to hollywood , and i 'm going to be <unk> for a while . ''
and then we started , we went to the <unk> , and they were exploring by <unk> .
and we turned back to the wreckage .
we took little robots that we built , which is a <unk> .
our intent was , <unk> , to look at the inner ship that was never been done before .
no one ever had the internal internal system . you have no way to do it . so we developed the technology .
and there i 'm sitting on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and see <unk> , which i know , that <unk> look like this , and i know that the band has played there .
and i fly with a little bit of <unk> through the aisles of the ship .
i 'm going to do it only , but my mind is within the <unk> .
it felt like i would be physically in the <unk> of the titanic .
this was the most complex form of a <unk> that i 've ever saw , because before i took a corner , i 'd been knew what was going to be in the <unk> of the <unk> , because i was going to go from <unk> when we turned the film .
and the set of the set was a little copy of the <unk> of the ship .
so this was a highly curious experience .
she was aware of this hollywood idea that you can use such <unk> avatars and so your own awareness in the vehicle , in these other forms of existence .
it was really incredible .
and maybe a little bit of reference to that may happen in a few decades , if you have been able to do something that might be able to explore something or to do other things , in all sorts of things that i can imagine .
now , after this led , we started that , which we 've seen in the bottom , really appreciate , for example , these <unk> , where we saw this incredibly memorable animals . these are sort of <unk> , but here on earth .
they live with <unk> .
it does n't exist in a sunlight of sunlight that we do .
and this is how you see animals , which is to say that you can survive there .
and for the same time , i was also interested in <unk> , which was the <unk> from my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in to space and to do with this , and in the <unk> , and right now , and right ? you drive to russia , you go through russia , and it 's all about
and that was fascinating .
but at the end of the end , it was that i took back to the deep sea .
and i took them with you , and i 'm going to take you access to the world in the world , <unk> , <unk> , people who were interested for these extreme situations , and i put them into the vents and to test instruments and so forth .
we turned out of this , but actually , in fact , a science , more specifically , more specifically .
so the circle between my existence as a <unk> , as a child , and the manifestation of reality .
and over the course of this <unk> , i have learned a lot .
i 've learned a lot of science , but i 'm sure you 're now going to be a director , an leader has to be a <unk> or so .
but i did n't understand a lot of leadership before i 'm going to solve .
because at a certain point , i had to say , `` what am i going to do here ?
why do i do this ? what comes out here ? ''
this <unk> movies do n't bring us money .
we 're going to play in the <unk> of the <unk> .
everybody think i was between `` titanic '' and `` avatar '' and `` hide '' and i would have a <unk> on a towel on a towel on the beach .
i 've all been all these films , these documentaries , for a very small audience .
no powers , no honor , no money , no money . what are you just doing ?
you 're doing it around the job of the will to be the challenge , and the ocean is the scaling environment that you are . you 're doing it , and because of the weird connection that creates a team .
because we 've done all of this with all 10 to 12 people that have been done , and sometimes we had two to three months on lake .
and in this community , you can recognize that the most important thing is that you have an idea that you have one one , because you have a problem that you can not explain .
and if you go back to land , and says , `` we had to do it , that 's <unk> , the whole way , the whole technology , and the difficulty , the human <unk> , if you 're working on lake , '' you just ca n't
there 's a connection that creates a pattern of respect .
so when i came back , to turn my next film `` avatar , '' i tried to apply the same leadership , which is that you deserve his team and makes them feel ashamed .
it was really changing the dynamic .
so , there 's a little bit with a little team on <unk> terrain . we turned `` avatar , '' with a new technology that has n't yet .
it 's been exciting .
a huge challenge .
and we were in a real family .
it 's got my way to make films , and it 's completely entirely completely .
there were people who thought that we would really have been doing this kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> on the planet .
it was more a <unk> way to do my job , the actual process that has changed the outcome .
so what can we close from all this ?
what about lessons we have learned ?
i think , i think , is a curiosity .
it 's the most powerful human human trait .
our imagination is a force that can even make a reality .
and the warning of your team is more important than all the <unk> of the world .
to me , to come to my filmmaker who say , `` give me a advice like me . ''
and i say , `` do n't think of yourself .
you can see that there are other for you . do n't do you , bet not against yourself . do n't take risks . ''
the nasa is so <unk> : `` failure is no alternative . ''
but in the art and to study an alternative , because there will be a <unk> .
not an important endeavor , that innovation started demanding the innovation , ever dealt without risk .
you have to be prepared to take risks like that .
so , that 's the idea that i 'd like to give you on the way . it 's a alternative , fear is not . thank you .
today i talk to you about energy and climate .
and that may be a surprise , because my favorite research at the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds that we have to invent , about the poorest two billion lives .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , right now , more important than any other other on the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> are not going to grow over many years , we 're not expanding . it 's going to rain too much or much rain . the things are going to change that it will not change how it could not withstand its <unk> environment .
it leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty .
so , will be a climate change .
and lastly , the <unk> for you is very important .
the fact is that if you could only reduce the price to the price , to <unk> energy , energy would be far from most effective .
well , the <unk> is like time .
in fact , the <unk> is based on <unk> .
the <unk> drive to the industrial revolution , and in the 20th century , there were a <unk> case in the <unk> , and so we have refrigerators , <unk> , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
so we 're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but if we reduce the price -- let 's go down the price -- we make a new barrier and these barrier depends on co2 .
co2 warms up the planet and the equation of co2 is really fairly clear .
they <unk> the <unk> co2 , which leads to the <unk> , and these <unk> have some very negative consequences . effects , maybe worse , the indirect result , the one-eyed result , that the natural ecosystems can not adapt , and so <unk> all the systems .
now , the exact relationship between a <unk> and that can be brightest in the same <unk> and where their other consequences are , there 's some <unk> , but not very many .
and there 's sure of <unk> about how bad these consequences are , but they will be extremely bad .
i asked a few times several times , `` we need to get down to zero to zero ?
is not the half or a quarter ? ''
the answer is , until we get close to zero , the temperature goes down .
so it 's a big challenge .
it 's very different as to say , we have to have a 3.5 feet of high truck that have to be under an three feet of bridge , and then you can just get it on a <unk> .
this is all going to be down to zero .
well , we pull a lot of <unk> out of , over 26 billion tons .
every american americans are about 20 tons , people from poor countries , less than one .
it 's about five tons of every year for everybody on the planet .
and somehow we need to reduce changes that will lower zero .
it 's actually constant static .
just different economic changes have been influenced at all , and we need to get to reducing , and we need to get to reducing , and we need to go to reducing , and one number to zero to zero .
this equation has four factors . you have a little bit of <unk> , and you have this thing on the left -- co2 -- that you want to be zero , and that 's going to depend from the number of people on the average , which will be an average of the average , the average energy for every service and the co2 that will be <unk> for any
so let 's look at every factor of one , and let 's think how we get to zero .
probably one of these numbers have to come to zero .
now this is the basic algebra , but i 'll go through it .
so first , we have the population .
today , 6.8 billion people .
and it 's about 9 billion . that 's nine billion .
if we 're very successful with new <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> , we can lower 10 percent to 15 percent , but at time we see a slope of 1.3 .
the second factor are the services that we use .
this is all the food that we eat , clothes , television , heating .
these are very good things and <unk> means that services can be available to each other on the planet .
it 's great that that number is rising .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we could do <unk> and less use , but in average , that number is going to be more than double , more than double , more than double the number of services that will be put .
so here 's a very basic service , there are light on home so you can read the homework ?
and these students do n't have it , so they go out and read their <unk> under the <unk> .
now , in efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there 's finally good news .
we have something that is not going up .
because of different successes in <unk> , through other <unk> , through new methods of <unk> , there are lots of services , which are many services to reduce some individual services to reduce 90 percent .
in other service , like making <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> or <unk> or <unk> , is the <unk> for improvement .
all right , if we are optimistic , we may get a factor of one factor three or maybe even a factor of six .
but in the first three factors , we 're now from 26 billion , maybe 13 billion tons of billion tons , and it 's just not just out of !
so we see the fourth factor -- and this will be a <unk> -- this is the amount of co2 that will be a <unk> .
it 's the question that you can get to zero .
if you burn coal : no .
if you burn natural gas : no .
almost any <unk> for electricity today today , except renewables , except renewables and <unk> .
so what we need to do is to create a global system .
we need <unk> .
now , if i use the term `` miracle '' i do n't mean the impossible .
the <unk> is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and services is a miracle .
the people here have contributed to the development of many these miracles .
usually , there 's no way of <unk> that you need a miracle to a certain date .
usually it 's just the way you 're looking at and some people do n't .
but in this case , we need to be <unk> and get a miracle in very short time .
now , i asked me , how can i really get this ?
is there a natural <unk> , a demonstration of the human beings here ?
i remembered my last year when i got <unk> , and somehow , people liked that .
the idea was really true for you , you know , that there are people living with mosquitos .
i noticed this one .
i decided that the <unk> of fireflies would be my <unk> contribution to the environment .
so here 's some natural fireflies .
you have told me that they do n't bite . actually , you 're not going to leave the glass .
well , there are all sorts of things like this , but they do n't have a lot .
we need solutions , either or several of these are a tremendous scale and tremendous <unk> , and even though there are many directions where people are looking for after that , i really can afford this big demand .
i 've got <unk> , <unk> , fusion and <unk> .
now , you know , if you have a <unk> , and if you do better , and if you can afford better , it would be great , but my statement here is that we need to give up all of these five jobs , and we ca n't give you a little bit of
so let 's look at the beginning of the burn fossil fuels , burning of either coal or coal or natural gas .
now , what you have to do there , may be easy , but it 's not . you should have to burn all the co2 that burn out of the <unk> , <unk> , down , and hope it 's <unk> .
there 's a couple of <unk> , which is going to get it on a 60 percent -- 80 percent of it will get 80 percent , but it 's going to get a big challenge , and a big challenge , and the biggest problem here is the
who will make sure ?
who can guarantee something that literally many billion times larger than any kind of garbage that you can imagine by <unk> and other things ?
this is a lot of volume .
so that 's a hard time .
next : <unk> .
it also has three big problems , the cost , but especially in <unk> countries , the question of safety is that you really feel nothing wrong , despite the human <unk> that the fuel is not used for weapons .
and what do you do with the trash ?
because although he 's not very big , there 's a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that may be solvable , and that 's why you should be working .
the last three of the five five five five five five five five , i 'm summarized .
it 's the renewables as they 're often called .
and also -- although it 's great that you do n't need a fuel -- you have some downsides .
one is the <unk> that these technologies are creating dramatic than the <unk> .
these are <unk> , you talk about many <unk> , thousand times more area than a normal power station .
and also , to these vents <unk> .
the sun does n't seem to be all the day , but they do n't seem to be every day , and they do n't even do the wind .
and therefore , if you have to depend on these sources , you have to have a way to get energy in times when they do n't have available .
so there are great <unk> here . there are challenges in the led . if we say , for example , that the energy to say that the energy is because , for example , it 's not just the technology , you have to deal with the risk that the energy of where it comes from .
and there 's the <unk> .
and to show the dimension , i 've been using all sorts of batteries that will look like , the computer , mobile phones , phones , <unk> , for everything , and i found that all the batteries that we can produce , less than 10 minutes of
so we need a big breakthrough , something that will be a factor of a factor as a result of time .
it 's not impossible , but it 's not that easy .
that 's what happens when you try to take these <unk> vents over 20 percent -- 30 percent of the space .
if you want to survive 100 percent on it , you need an incredible <unk> .
now , where should we go : what is the right approach ?
a manhattan project ? how do we get to the goal ?
what we need are many companies that work on it . hundreds of them .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
you 're going to say , `` you 're crazy ! that 's good .
i think here in the ted group here , there are many , many , a lot of people in this .
bill 's got several companies , among other people , one called a great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invest in dozens companies making great things and really interesting opportunities , and i try to support that .
nathan <unk> and i finance a company , maybe surprisingly , the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in <unk> ; <unk> , liquid .
now , the development has stopped in this industry before some time , so it 's not a big surprise that some good concepts develops around .
the <unk> means that instead of part of the <unk> , that one percent , the <unk> , we decided to burn the 99 percent .
it 's a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you 've been thinking about it , but you could never simulate that it would work , but there 's been modern supercomputers , you can see it , and see , you know , there 's no way .
and because you burn these 99 percent , it 's very much better .
in fact , you burn the trash , and you can even use the waste of reactors as <unk> .
instead of break the head , they burn it . a great thing .
the uranium is <unk> , a little bit like a candle .
you see that it 's a kind of column , often as a result of a <unk> reactor .
this is really the <unk> .
here 's a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , which is 99 percent , you have the part of which you burn today , so it 's called <unk> uranium .
this is going to be the u.s. economy for hundreds of years .
and when you 're cheap , and just <unk> , you get enough <unk> for the rest of the planet .
you know , there are many challenges , but it 's an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward .
think about how we should measure our success .
how should our statement be ?
now , let 's go up to the goal that we have to reach , and then we talk about the <unk> .
many of them talk about 80 percent reduction to 2050 .
it 's really very important that we get there .
and the rest of 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and hopefully it will be something that we 're going to be agriculture .
so , to reach these 80 percent , the developed world , including countries , including countries like china , their <unk> .
the other note , if we use the <unk> technology , whether they 're used in all the developed countries , and we 're on the rest of it .
that 's great important .
this is going to be a key element of this <unk> .
so if we go back from there , how should the 2020 statement ?
it would contain the two elements again .
we should use the <unk> , to bring reducing to the way , the less we <unk> , the more powerful will be the <unk> , and the temperature .
but in fact , this note of the things that we 're going to have to do is to lead to the large <unk> , just the same , or even something much important like the other ones , which is the <unk> of innovation for these breakthroughs .
we need to track these breakthroughs with <unk> , and we can measure , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there are many great books in this topic .
al gore , `` we have the choice '' and david <unk> `` <unk> energy <unk> the glamour . ''
they really go through and create a framework where these are going to be discussed , because we need support for all sides .
there have to come together that needs to come together .
that 's a desire .
a very <unk> desire that we make this technology .
if you just take one wish for the next 50 years , i could pick up the president , and that 's what i 'm going to do , or i could choose this desire , which is , <unk> <unk> without co2 .
this is the biggest impact .
if we do n't get this desire , the digging between the long and in the short term , people will be terrible , between the united states , between the u.s. and china , between poor and rich countries , and almost every life of these two billion will be very much worse .
so what do we need to do ?
so what do i do ?
we need to use more <unk> .
if countries are in places like <unk> , they 're not just talking about co2 .
and you should talk about these <unk> , and you would be asked by this ridiculous amount of money that are spent for these innovative approaches .
we need <unk> co2 , <unk> and <unk> & amp , which is a <unk> .
we need to spread the message .
we need to take a dialogue of <unk> and full , and also the things that will be done by government .
it 's an important desire , but i think we can satisfy him .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much , so much to understand anything better -- first , can you give us an idea of the scale of this investment ?
bill gates : the simulation on a supercomputers will get all of the big scientists , what we 've done , we need only to have some 10 million , and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it works , it 's just in the <unk> million .
the difficult step is building the first <unk> , to find more billion , the <unk> , and the place that actually builds the first of them .
as soon as the first was done , if it 's going like that , it 's really clear , because the economy , the <unk> is so different than you know .
so to understand that , that means deep into the ground , almost like a vertical <unk> of nuclear <unk> , this device , and then the process starts on the top , and goes down to bottom ?
bg : right now . now , today you have to <unk> the reactor , so there are many people and many of the brain that can be wrong right , and there 's a lot of the thing that you can where you open it and you 're going to be
but if you have a very cheap fuel , you can actually think of it for 60 years -- think about a column -- that 's buried without all the <unk> .
and it 's there and it 's lunch for 60 years , and then it 's finished .
a <unk> that offers a solution to the trash .
bg : yes . now , what 's happening with the garbage : you can sit there -- there 's plenty of garbage with this way -- you take it into the next reactor and burn it .
and we start by taking the garbage that 's already in these <unk> , or <unk> that 's because of reactors . this is our <unk> .
so , that 's what these reactors have a problem , which is what we fill in it , and that 's what we 're doing with this , and that 's what we 're going to make is dramatic and dramatically reduce the footprint that 's dramatic during this process .
but as you talk to different people about these things .
where 's the greatest interest , what really does ?
bg : now we have n't been looking at a place , and there 's a lot of interesting <unk> for everything that is in this `` nuclear , '' and that 's kind of <unk> in the name of `` a company , '' there 's big interest and the people of the company in russia , india -- i was in here and talking about
i 'm optimistic . you know the french and japanese have something in the direction .
this is a flavor of one thing that was made .
so this is an important step forward , but it 's like a faster reactor and some countries built this , so everybody , of the <unk> reactor , a <unk> for our first .
you know , in your idea , <unk> and probability are really going to be going to life ?
bg : now we need one of these phrases , <unk> things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then for 20 years .
that 's kind of the <unk> that we have to acknowledge the <unk> that we need to do .
and you know , you know , <unk> , if everything goes good , and that 's a great wish , it could be easy .
and fortunately , there 's dozens of companies , and we need hundreds of companies , and we need hundreds of things that works as their approaches to work for their pilots .
and it would be the best , if there 's several , because then you could use a mixture .
in any case , we need a solution .
am the emergence of the big possible breakthroughs , is this the biggest thing you know ?
bg : a <unk> is the <unk> .
it would have been there without the <unk> , but it 's still so much more important .
in a nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we do n't know their work like this , but there 's the <unk> way , that 's another approach .
there 's a liquid <unk> , which seems difficult , but maybe tell us that about us .
so there 's different , but the nice thing is that a million times has a million times as much energy as one , say , well , if you can deal with the problems , and that 's mostly the potential , the impact , the impact on the country and the cost , the impact on the country and other things ,
if it does n't work , what ?
do we have to add <unk> to keep the <unk> stable ?
bg : if you come in this situation , it 's as if you have too much a heart attack , and a short heart attack , so what do you do ?
and there 's a <unk> that 's called <unk> , which is to be with various techniques to delay global warming for us to be the warming , so we would take 20 or 30 years to be <unk> .
this is just a <unk> .
you hope we do n't need that .
some people say , you know , you 're not supposed to be able to work in insurance because you may be lazy , so you 're going to eat , because you know that you will save a <unk> .
i do n't know if the importance of this problem leads to this problem , but there 's a discourse in <unk> if you should have that , if things come faster , or that innovation need to be longer than we expect .
<unk> : have you or two sentences for the to persuade you to convince you ?
bg : now , this is the skeptics in the very different <unk> .
the ones that make science arguments are very little .
tell you that there are negative effects that have to do with the clouds that move things ?
there are very few things that you can say at all , have a chance to be in a million .
the <unk> here is like aids .
you make the mistake now , and you spend a lot later .
and so the idea is now , if you have all sorts of potential problems in something that is just later , and comes out that the investment is not so clear , in fact , is not necessarily the worst thing that is not necessarily the worst scenario , and there is people in the rich world that is looking at and say , ok , that is not a big drama .
the fact is that these uncertainty should worry about us .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economic , and at the same time , the co2 is <unk> , say , `` okay , it does n't matter that it 's not a co2 , i 'm going to accept it , but i 'm going to accept
and that would be their answer to the <unk> argument that if you used all of these time and energy to solve the co2 , all the other goals of malaria , the <unk> , the <unk> of malaria and so on , that it 's a dumb waste of resources to invest , while there are better things that we can do .
bg : now , the actual spending for the research -- we 're going to spend 10 billion per year more than you do today -- that 's not quite dramatic .
it should not suffering .
you go to big <unk> , and you can recommend reasonable a reasonable people , if you have something that is not economic , and trying to pay it to me .
because it 's very short , and for example , is just the learning learning , i think we should try to be more things that have the potential to be very much cheaper .
if you get a <unk> , you can get a very high <unk> , you can just keep the wealthy .
i mean , every one of us here could spend five times as much for our energy without going to change your lifestyle .
for the lower two , it 's a disaster .
and even <unk> .
now , his new idea is now : `` why will not have been talking about that research ? ''
he still gets still because of his previous stories , with the <unk> , but he realized that that 's a very lonely group , and so he 's going to be the same thing .
and this is a flat line that i think is appropriate .
the research , it 's just crazy to be supported the way .
bill , i think i 'm talking to almost any people here when i say , i really hope you will be true . thank you very much .
bg : thank you .
a couple of years ago , here at ted , peter <unk> <unk> a <unk> called `` the <unk> . ''
the idea is pretty easy . <unk> , the best <unk> structure has to be <unk> structure with 20 <unk> , about <unk> tape , about <unk> and build a marshmallow .
the marshmallow has to be on the top .
and , although it really seems really easy , it 's actually hard to work very quickly .
and so i thought this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a <unk> .
it was a huge success .
since , i 've done about 70 workshops in the world , with students , <unk> and architects , even with <unk> , of <unk> , and there 's something on this task , which is allowed to share , and i want to share some of these with them .
usually most people start to start against themselves .
you talk about what it 's going to be like it 's going to be doing .
then they invest a little time in planning and organization . it 's <unk> , and they 're <unk> .
they invest in a lot of their time in the nanoscale , all urban structures .
and finally , quickly before you do n't have time , you take the marshmallow and you put it gently down at the top , take a step back and <unk> !
but then , what 's going to be , is that the `` <unk> '' is because the weight of <unk> is that all of the <unk> is that all of the time , the whole thing is <unk> and <unk> .
there 's a series of people who have a lot more `` <unk> '' ones as others , and among the worst are <unk> .
she lies , they cheat , they are confused and they make really exquisite shapes .
and of course , there 's also teams that have a lot more `` <unk> '' and the best of the best alumni of the <unk> .
and that 's pretty amazing .
like peter told us , they do n't just make the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you may be wondering , how do you come ? why ? why is what ?
and peter tells me , `` none of the kids are going to be going to be a <unk> of being <unk> . ''
they do n't invest time in <unk> .
but there 's another reason .
and that , <unk> were trained to find a real plan , ok !
and then to realize it .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you have no time and what happens ?
it 's a crisis .
sound familiar , what ?
so what <unk> do is , they start to start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , so they have the opportunity to repair <unk> prototypes .
now , <unk> recognize this kind of <unk> collaboration as a core of a <unk> .
and with any attempt that children get directly feedback what works and what does not .
so the performance is working with prototypes , but we see how different teams operate .
now , the average rate for most of them is about <unk> , is about half of them , is something more , but not much , more than the adults .
who 's the most successful ?
architects and engineers , thankfully .
<unk> is the highest thing i saw .
and why ? because they can understand triangles and <unk> geometric patterns are the key to build stable structures .
now , ceos are something about average , but it 's going to be interesting .
you put a <unk> <unk> on the team , you will be meaningful .
it 's incredible . you can see and see , `` this team will win . ''
you can predict the prediction . why is that ?
because they have special skills of the <unk> .
they lead the process , you understand it .
and that team , that makes sense of mind , and the work of doing the work of the team of the team .
<unk> skills and <unk> and their combination are leading to success .
if you have 10 teams , the typical way , you have about six , the robust structures .
now i tried to talk about something .
i thought , i 'm going to take the <unk> .
so i spent a <unk> price of software for the winner .
what do you think about that ?
what was the result ?
this is this . not a team had a robust structure .
if somebody would have built a <unk> construction , he would have propelled the price .
so is n't it not interesting that high injury have a huge effect ?
we repeated this exercise with the same students .
now , what 's happened ?
now they understood the advantage of `` <unk> . ''
this is the same , bad team of one .
it 's produced the highest construction in the same time .
so , there are <unk> lessons for us , about nature of incentive and success .
you like , why would somebody actually create time to create a <unk> ?
the reason is , i create digital tools and processes to help team team and make cars , video games and <unk> <unk> .
and what the <unk> is doing , it allows them to have hidden assumptions .
because open , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge is a common experience , a common language or a common way of building the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in to visit <unk> .
it 's a blog where you build the <unk> .
there 's a <unk> there .
you find crazy examples of all the world , how people optimize the system .
there are also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think , is actually a <unk> sport .
it means that we all have our senses on the task , and that we 're going to use our ethical things like our feelings and our feelings , in the challenge that is our challenge .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is everything it needs to take us from a `` <unk> '' -- to a <unk> moment .
and that can be a huge divergence .
thank you very much .
so do we have a machine .
a big machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and this is a time machine .
and everybody in this room needs to go inside .
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; you can not be in the future . you can not stay in here .
and i wonder what you would choose , because i asked my friends in the last time , and they wanted to go to the past .
i do n't know . they wanted back to the time before there were cars or twitter or `` america is looking at the idol . ''
i do n't know .
and i 'm convinced that you can be stepping into that way , to be connected .
and that 's what i understand .
i 'm not part of this group , i need to say .
i do n't want to be in the past , and that 's not because i 'm a <unk> .
it 's because , in fact , opportunities to go back on this planet , they go ahead .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go to the future .
this is the greatest time that existed on this planet , no matter that you have to make , health , wealth , mobility , declining .
there was never one time like this .
my <unk> died all when they were 60 .
my grandparents picked up this number to 70 .
my parents are the 80 one .
so , that should be a nine at the beginning of my <unk> .
but it 's not about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child that can be born in new delhi today to live as long as the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about it . that 's an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox has killed billion people on this planet .
you have the demographics of the earth in a way to kind of rebuild the world .
they are gone . they are gone .
we 've got them . <unk> .
in the rich world , there are diseases that millions of diseases , the millions of us are still threatened to a generation , not still .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
anybody still know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are successes of the scientific method .
and from my perspective , the scientific way of doing things , looking at things if it works , if it does n't do it , one of the great breakthroughs of mankind .
so that 's the good news .
sadly , this is all the good news , because there are some other problems , and they have been mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , i have a billion people on the world to go hungry every day .
this number is rising , and it 's very quickly , and it 's embarrassing .
and not just that , we have been used to <unk> this world .
drinking water , <unk> land , rainforests , oil , oil , gas , gas : disappear , and if we do n't go from this chaos .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think i think .
i think it 's clear that we can produce food , which will feed billions of people , without the land that they live , to rape .
i think we can do this world with energy that they would not destroy .
i really think that really , and no , this is no wonder .
but this is me awake at night -- one of the things that i 'm going to do awake at night . we have never been doing science progress all the way .
and we 've never been able to have been able to set it up , and we 've never been able to display it , so how we can today .
we 're going to have been an amazing , amazing events on many areas , and yet i really think we really think we have hundreds of 300 years ago to find a time to find a time in which we 're fighting progress in the world we have
the people <unk> in their believe , and it 's so deeply deeply that you ca n't lift them .
not even the truth will be free .
and listen , everybody has a right to think , even a right to the opinion .
but you know what you do n't have right ?
they 're not right on their own facts .
and i needed a while to figure out that .
about a decade ago , i have an article about <unk> for `` the new yorker , '' a little article .
and i was amazed to run on resistance on resistance to the way that at the end of the world 's most effective market in the history of human history .
i did n't know what i should do , so i just did what i 'm going to do , i wrote a article .
and soon i wrote an article about <unk> <unk> .
the same thing , it 's just bigger .
the people were playing crazy .
so i wrote a article about it , and i could n't understand why people thought that would be `` <unk> , why they believed that molecule is a certain kind of a random kind of <unk> of nature .
but you know , i 'm doing what i 'm doing . i wrote the article , i went on .
i mean , i 'm a journalist .
we show you , we 're going to go , we 're eating , that 's okay .
but these papers made me , and i could n't figure out why , and eventually i found it .
and that 's because these <unk> that i did n't have to do crazy .
these were <unk> people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that made me like this .
but then i thought , you know what , to be honest .
we are in a point where we do n't have to confront the same relationship for progress as the used .
we 're talking about <unk> .
we 're talking ironic , with little <unk> of technology : progress .
okay , there are reasons , and i think we know what reasons that are .
we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , and there 's no reason why that should not be that way .
you can just call you a couple of names , and the people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , weapons , the <unk> .
i mean , you know , you can pick your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people we thought they 're always right . so , be skeptical .
imagine , demand for evidence , demand a question .
do n't take nothing as a result .
but i 'm going to get you now , if you need to take this evidence , you have to adopt this evidence , and it 's not good .
and i can tell that , and i can live in a epidemic of fear fear , how i never saw you , hopefully never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a horrible story , which brought the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
very scary .
tons of studies were done to see if that was true .
tons of studies should be conducted ; that 's a serious matter .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all periphery , no correlation , no connection , no one .
it makes no difference . it does n't matter , because we believe in anecdotes we believe what we see to see what makes what makes us think that we feel really feel .
we do n't think about a bunch of documents of a <unk> that gives us data , and i understand that , i think , we all do .
but you know what ?
and the result of it was <unk> .
so <unk> because of this fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world , in which increase <unk> for <unk> .
that 's <unk> , and we should be ashamed .
it 's terrible .
what happens we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do this .
because anybody <unk> here ?
has one one in the audience ever saw somebody else else ?
not very often .
it 's not happening in this country in this country , but invited 160,000 around the world in the last year .
these are many deaths in <unk> , 20 per hour .
but because that 's not here , we can make it out , and people like sarah <unk> can be around and <unk> around fear and illiteracy images like oprah and larry king live live .
and you can do that because they do n't connect .
you do n't understand that these things seem alike , but almost almost the same thing .
and this is something we need to learn , and it 's very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
it <unk> us from one of the worst <unk> of mankind .
no fear , no <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
the guy in the middle , not so much .
he 's called paul <unk> .
he 's just set up with some other people a few other people .
he can save the lives of <unk> , 500,000 children per year in the developing world .
pretty good , not ?
well , that 's good , except that paul walk walking and talking about vaccines and says how valuable you are , and that people should just stop <unk> .
and he actually says that .
so paul is a terrorist .
if paul <unk> in a public <unk> , he can not say without armed <unk> .
he gets calls at home , because people like to tell him to tell him that you know where his children go to school .
and why ? because paul did a <unk> .
i do n't need that , but vaccines are essential .
and you 're going to take you back , take the diseases back , horrible diseases , and this is happening .
now , we have <unk> in this country now .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon kids are dying again , because that 's just a question of numbers .
and they 're not just dying at <unk> .
what about <unk> ? do we take it . why not ?
i wrote a couple of a couple of weeks ago , and i 'd say i 'm a little bit to <unk> .
no one ever said that .
she would n't be able to immunize your child against <unk> .
subtle .
why ? because we do n't have <unk> . and you know what ?
we had no problem in this country yesterday .
today , i do n't know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , i 'm going to go to someone in a plane , and it 's going to go to los angeles , right now he 's about ohio .
and in a couple of hours , he and <unk> a car , and he comes to long beach , and he 's going to visit one of these <unk> <unk> tonight .
and he does n't know that with a <unk> disease , and we do n't know that , because the world works now .
this is the planet that we live in . do n't do it as if he 's not .
we love to lie in lying . we love that .
have you all taken all the vitamins for all the vitamins ?
so , <unk> , a little <unk> that helps them to do it .
i know you 've done that because half of americans do it every day .
you take this stuff , and you take an alternative cure , and it makes no difference , how often we find them useless .
the data show you all the time .
they <unk> their urine . they never do .
that 's okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i agree to them .
it 's dark . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do it ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the drug industry .
we hate a strong government . we do n't have access to the system .
and we do n't want to do that . our health system is <unk> .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely incredible and <unk> to us that can afford it .
so we walk out before , and where do we go ?
we 're going to walk into the poor of the <unk> .
that 's great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , this is really a serious matter , because the stuff is dung , and we spend billions of dollars .
and i have all sorts of little artifacts here .
none of it -- <unk> , cheating , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , i do n't know what that is , but we 're giving billions of dollars , it 's <unk> .
and you know what ? i say , shout me and say , `` what do you care ? but let people do what they want .
that 's how they feel good . ''
and you know what ? they 're wrong .
because it does n't matter whether it 's the minister of health , saying , `` hmm , i 'm going to take the evidence of my experts to mammography or some <unk> who wants to treat his patient with <unk> .
if you go to this way , where i think , it 's a magic evidence and science , and science can get to a place that you do n't want to be .
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he brought up 400,000 to people , because he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs that we know that they can see that they can see .
hundreds of thousands of <unk> deaths in a country that will be worse than any other one of this disease .
please do n't tell me that these things have no consequences .
they have them . they always have .
now , the <unk> epidemic that we 're right now is this ridiculous fight between the <unk> <unk> food and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . it has to stop .
it 's a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every single <unk> , every branch of <unk> , everybody else has been changing by people .
you know , there was no <unk> in paradise .
there was no <unk> hatch .
there was no first christmas . we did it all .
we 've done it over the last month .
and some of them worked and some of them do n't work .
we 're leaving , what does n't work .
now , we can do it in a way , and of course , it 's risks . but we can do something like <unk> a in rice , and that stuff can help millions of people , can make millions of people .
you do n't want to do that ?
i need to say that i do n't understand .
we fixed food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i hear is to many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we do n't want a huge amount of fields with one thing .
we do n't want to patent companies .
we do n't want companies have seeds .
and you know what my answer is ?
yes , you have right . we fix that .
it 's true , we have a huge problem , but it 's not science .
this is nothing to do with science .
it 's right , morality .
you know that science is no company .
it 's not a country .
it 's not an idea ; it 's a process .
it 's a process , and sometimes it works , sometimes it 's sometimes not , but the idea that we should n't have to allow science to do their work , because we 're afraid of a real end , and it 's going to get millions of people from flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years , we 're going to grow 70 percent more food than the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
shame . how many .
you need that , and we do n't give them .
and why ? the reality is <unk> food .
we do n't want to encourage people to eat this <unk> stuff like <unk> .
<unk> is something that is a half billion people .
it 's about like a <unk> .
it 's just a bunch of calories . it 's <unk> .
it does n't have nutrients , it does n't have any protein , and scientists are building all that in a way .
and then the people could eat the food , and they would not be blind .
you would not be starvation , and you know what ?
it would be beautiful . it would n't be <unk> , but it would be beautiful .
and everything i can say is : why do we do this ?
i mean , let 's ask , why do we do this ?
because we want to <unk> genes ?
it 's not about genes . it 's not about chemicals .
it 's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our <unk> to <unk> food , better food , even food .
it 's not about rice <unk> , it 's about getting people alive , and it 's going to be highest time to understand what that means .
you know what ?
if we do n't do that , when we do what we do , we do n't want to do something like that , i think , i think , do n't want to be guilty , high-tech colonialism .
there 's no other description of what happens here .
it 's selfish , it 's ugly , it 's our <unk> , and we have to stop that .
so after this incredibly fun conversation , you may say , `` well , you 're still going to go in this ridiculous time ? ''
absolutely , i want to fall .
now , in the present , they are in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put these time back to everything we want .
we can <unk> them where we want to <unk> them , and we will move it where we want .
we need to take these conversations , and we need to think , but if we get into the time , and go into the future , we 're going to be happy to have .
i know that we can , and as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as i think , is something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
i mean , for some time , i 'm interested in the <unk> . it may be curious that a magician is interested in , because i think you 're looking like `` a deception that will be going to something that will be true enough to do it . ''
in other words , <unk> have shown in some studies in some studies , the <unk> , and it 's just a way of thinking about what 's happening with you , is a <unk> or a kind of -- in the <unk> , in the <unk> , for example , there 's a measurable effect in the body that you call the
a deception will be a real thing , because somebody does this .
so , to understand each other , i want to show you a fundamental , simple magic trick .
and i 'm going to show you how he works . that 's a trick that has been at least since the 1950s 's the 1950s .
i even learned him from the <unk> magic of <unk> in the 1970s .
i will do it for you and then explain it .
and then i 'm going to explain why i explain it .
so , look what happens .
and the knife that you can study ; my hand that can look at .
i 'm going to keep the knife just in my hand .
i <unk> my sleeve .
and to make sure , nothing in my sleeve disappears , i 'm going to go out , i 'm just going to leave my wrist right here .
and you can see that you can see that i can see that it 's not going to move around anything , and as long as i 'm <unk> here , there 's nothing in my sleeve .
and the goal is that it 's very simple .
i 'm going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything is doing , the knife will be <unk> by my bare <unk> .
in fact , in fact , in fact , he 's sitting in this place that i can shake it , without the knife <unk> .
nothing goes out in my sleeve , or comes out , not <unk> , and you can study everything .
<unk> !
now , this is a trick that i often think about very little kids that are interested in magic , because you can learn very much about deception , although it 's a very simple trick .
probably , many of them are familiar with this trick .
and it works .
i think the knife in my hand .
i say my wrist of <unk> to make sure nothing in my sleeve or comes out , and that 's a lie .
the reason i 'm talking about my wrist is that this is the real secret of the illusion .
so , in the moment , where i 'm looking at my hand , so you can see them from the back , this finger here , my <unk> , just where he 's so <unk> .
amazing trick ?
somebody else is sitting in back to the back of the back .
so , he 's here . right .
and when i <unk> myself , the fingers changes its position .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you do n't understand that there is just three fingers down , because the mind and the way that it causes information is not important , one , two , three , three ,
but that 's actually not really , i 'm not going to get my hand .
of course , it 's going to be <unk> , but not through the <unk> of my body , but through a trick , through my <unk> , which is now .
and if i leave my hand , the same thing happens by <unk> , hidden from this movement is coming down again .
i take this hand away . and here 's the knife .
so , that trick is you can demonstrate your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what has the pop-up menu ?
i read a year ago , or that , i read a study that has really been <unk> me .
i 'm not a doctor or researchers , and that 's why i was an amazing thing .
this is what 's turned out , if you provide a <unk> in the form of a white pill , in the form of a <unk> , it 's just a circular , white pill , which has a particular measurable effect .
but if you look at the shape that you 're going to change the <unk> , for example , to a smaller pill , and these blue staining and a letter on it , it 's actually growing more effective .
and that , although none of them are any of it -- it 's just <unk> .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that really blew me .
it turns out that this is not all .
if you take a <unk> , you 're still more effective than any ecosystem .
a colored capsule , which is <unk> yellow and at the other red is better than a white capsule .
it 's also a role .
one pill : twice every day is not as good as three pills -- i 'm not going to remember the same statistic . sorry .
but the question is , ...
... that 's the way that they play a role .
and the shape is a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate <unk> , you have to <unk> the needle .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> of a <unk> substance that you can do with a patient .
that 's creating a very strong picture in my head , that 's a lot of times more than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i 'm going to show you another time when we have a <unk> .
so , the fact is that the white pill does n't matter as well as the blue pill , which does not move as well as a capsule that does not move as good as the needle .
and none of it has any really <unk> trait . it 's just our belief that makes us feel a stronger impact .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a trick .
i 'm going to take something that is a deception , and let 's look at it .
and we know from this study that you have to reach to the needle when it 's supposed to be .
this is a 18 inches of a long time , and it 's very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , a little bit of <unk> .
this is really my meat . it 's not a <unk> <unk> meat .
this is my skin . this is not a <unk> from hollywood .
so i 'm going to stick this needle in my skin and put through it , until they <unk> back on the other side again .
if you 're evil , if you 're slightly stressed in <unk> -- i have a couple of friends at the room last night in the hotel room and some people that i did n't know , and that 's a woman 's <unk> .
so i propose if you 're going to be evil , look for you to look at the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i 'm going to do the first <unk> part here .
you can see it in the same , but you can also get <unk> if you want .
so , this is what i 'm going to start , where my meat starts , i 'll just get a little bit of a <unk> .
i 'm sorry . do you make it crazy ?
now , just a little bit through my skin and on the other side .
now we 're actually in the same situation that we had in <unk> .
about this .
but now you ca n't count , right ?
so , i 'm going to show you . that 's one , two , three , five .
now .
i know what people think if you see this .
you say , `` okay , that 's not that stupid and you 're going to talk about the skin . ''
well , then i 'll show you .
what does this look like ? pretty well .
yes , i know .
and the people say , `` okay . i do n't know that . ''
the people in the <unk> are coming in .
so let me show you close to you .
this is really my skin . this is not a <unk> of hollywood .
this is my meat , and i can get the <unk> .
i 'm sorry . if you 're evil , you look at , look at you .
and the people in the back , or the later that later looking at the video later , will say , `` well , yeah , this is fairly impressive , but if it would be really impressive , he would see , here 's a hole and there , if it was really real ,
okay , let me take a little blood for you .
yes , here it is .
i would usually take the needle .
i 'd clean my arm , and you show you that there are no wounds .
but i think in this picture here , and with the intention , to make a deception , i 'm going to make the needle in there , i 'm going to make the needle in there .
we 're going to face a couple of days .
thank you very much . thank you very much .
everybody is talking about happiness today .
i 've got some people count the number of books that were published with `` <unk> '' that were published in the title of the title in the last five years , and they gave about 40 , and there were many more .
there 's a tremendous wave of interest in my happiness .
there 's a lot of <unk> .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all of these tide work , there are several cognitive people that can make it almost impossible .
and my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive fall .
this is true of <unk> that you think about your own happiness , and it 's true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we 're just like every other .
the first of these fall is a <unk> , complexity .
it turns out that the word happiness is not just useful , because we apply it to many different things .
i think there 's a particular importance that we could tell you about , but all of this is something that we have to give up , and we 're going to take the complicated view of what well-being is .
the second case is a <unk> of experience and memory , it 's basically that you can be happy between your life and happy with his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they are both <unk> in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and that 's the <unk> fact that we can not think about a fact that well-being is influenced without its meaning .
i mean , this is a real cognitive impact .
there 's just no way to get it right .
now , i 'd like to start with one example of somebody who had a <unk> to one of my lectures that had a story , [ unclear ... ] he said he had a symphony , and it was absolutely gorgeous music , and at the end of the recording was a <unk> sound .
and then he added , really quite emotionally , that 's ruined the whole experience .
but it did n't .
what it was ruined in the memories were the experience .
he had had the experience .
he had 20 minutes <unk> music .
they were n't <unk> because he was <unk> with a memory that was ruined , and the memory was all that he had to keep .
and what 's really tells us that we can think about us and about other people in terms of two types of self .
there 's a <unk> self that lives in the present , and know the present , is able to experience the past , but basically only just the present .
it 's the <unk> self , that 's the doctor 's <unk> -- you know when the doctor asks , `` do it hurt if i 'm going to hurt you here ? ''
and then there 's a <unk> self , and the <unk> self is to keep that , and it 's the story of our life , and it 's the one , that 's the doctor 's <unk> by asking the question , `` how did you feel at last time ? ''
, `` how was your journey for albania ? '' or something like that . ''
these are two very different units , the <unk> self , and the <unk> self , and the two , is part of the <unk> of happiness .
now , the <unk> self is a storyteller .
and this is really beginning to be a basic response to our memory -- it begins immediately .
we do n't just tell stories , when we 're doing stories .
our memory is telling us stories , that means what we 're allowed to keep from our experiences is a story .
and let 's start with one example .
there 's a old study .
these are real patients who do n't have a painful job .
i 'm not going to go into detail . it 's not painful , but she was painful than this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all of 60 seconds about their pain .
and here 's two patient . these are their records .
and you say , `` who has more suffered ? ''
and that 's a very simple question .
patient b has clearly suffered more . his <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had had a patient b , and more .
but now there 's another question , `` how many people thought they were <unk> ? ''
and here 's a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient is a much <unk> <unk> to the <unk> .
the stories of the <unk> were different , and because a very important part of the story is how it ends .
and none of these stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
but one of them is clearly worse than the other .
and the worse , the worse is where the pain was at the end , it 's a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people after their <unk> , and we 'd say , `` how bad was the whole thing ? ''
and she was much worse for a than b in the <unk> .
now , this is a direct conflict between the <unk> self and the <unk> itself .
from the point of view , one of the <unk> self , b is a tremendous time .
now , what you could do with the patient , and we actually have clinical trials , and it 's been made , and it 's been made , and it works , and it 's actually working , you could actually get the <unk> of the patient to <unk> the hose in the hose
this will lead that the patient is suffering , but only less than before .
and if you take a couple of minutes , it makes you care about the patient 's mental self , and you have no matter that the <unk> self is a much better , because now you have a better story about his experience .
what is a story ?
and that 's true for the stories that allow us to do and it 's also true for the stories we invent .
and what a story is , <unk> are <unk> , great moments and end .
end is very , very important and in this case , the end is the end .
well , the <unk> self is living its lives .
it 's got a minute of the topic , one after the other .
and you ask , what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really easy . it 's always lost .
i mean , most moments of our life -- and i 've been doing this -- you know , you know , the psychological present is about about three seconds . what means , you know , there are about 600 million of them in a month , there are about 600,000 .
most of them are completely ignored by the <unk> self .
and yet , you have to count that you should be count that what 's happening during the moments of the <unk> is our lives .
it 's the limited resource we use as we are in the world .
and as we can use them seemingly important , but that 's not the story that makes the <unk> self for us .
so we have this <unk> self and the self , and they 're really quite different .
the largest difference between you is that way .
from perspective of the <unk> self , if you have a holiday , and the second week is just as good as the first week is the <unk> holidays twice as good as the <unk> vacation .
it does n't work for the <unk> self .
for the <unk> , a <unk> holiday is barely much better than the <unk> holiday , because there 's no new memories .
they did n't change the story .
and in this way , it 's actually the critical variable , which is a very important bit of different self , from a <unk> self , is very little impact on this story .
now , the <unk> self makes more than to remember and stories .
it 's actually a person that makes decisions , because if you have a patient , who 's got to say two different points of two different surgeons and decides that he 's supposed to pick up , and that 's the way that is the memory that 's been selected .
the <unk> self has no voice in this choice .
actually , we do n't choose between experiences . we pick between memory .
and even if we think about the future , we do n't think of our future as experiences .
we think about our future as a <unk> memory .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as an tyranny of the self , you know , as a tyranny of <unk> self , and you can think of the <unk> self as one , which is a little bit of <unk> , which is a little bit of <unk> , which does n't need .
i have the sense that if we 're going to do the very often the case , that means we 're going to make holidays in the services of the <unk> self .
and that 's a little bit difficult to justify , i think .
i mean , how do we do anything of our memories ?
that 's one of the explanations that will be for the dominance of the <unk> self .
and when i think about it , i think about a holiday that we 've been doing in the antarctica , which was clearly the best holiday i 've ever had , and i think relatively often in the relationship .
and i 've probably been looking at my memory of this <unk> journey , i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i 've ever opened the folder with 600 images that i had spent another hour .
well , these are three weeks , and that 's just a number of a hour .
there seems to be a disagreement .
now , i like a little extreme , you know , how little appetite i have to do on the memory of memory , but even if you do more of this , why do we give memories so much weight to the weight that we give experiences ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next holidays , you know that , at the end of the <unk> , all their images , and you get a <unk> drug , so you wo n't remember nothing .
now , would you pick the same vacation ?
and if you elect another holiday , there 's a conflict between their two selves , and you have to think about how to do this conflict , and it 's actually not obvious , because if you think you think about time , you have a answer .
why we chose the <unk> that we choose is a problem that makes us choice between the two types of self .
now , the two types of self , two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , one per per self .
so you can ask , how happy is the <unk> self ?
and then you would ask , how happy is the moments in the life of <unk> self ?
and they 're all -- happiness for moments is a rather complicated process .
so what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we 're now able to get a pretty good idea of the happiness of <unk> self .
and if you ask the lucky self , it 's a completely different thing .
this is not how happy one person lives .
it 's like content or <unk> the person , when this person is thinking about their lives .
very different .
anybody who do n't talk about these terms of happiness , and i 'm part of a lot of researchers about well-being that blew the study of happiness long in the same way .
and the distinction between the happiness of <unk> self and the happiness of self 's happiness self has been recognized in the last few years , and now you 're going to try to measure the two keys .
the <unk> organization has been a global survey , which is more than a million people have been asked about a half of a million people who had been asked about what they were thinking about their lives and about their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so over the last years , we have begun to learn about happiness of the two types of self .
and the main lesson that we think i think i have learned is that they are really different .
you can know how somebody with his life , and it does n't talk a lot about how happy he lives his life and the other way .
just to convey a sense of correlation that 's about correlation is about <unk> .
what that means is that if you hit somebody , and you would say , oh , his father is a <unk> , how many would you know about his size ?
now , you would know something about its size , but there 's a lot of uncertainty .
you have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that somebody 's eight in a scale of a scale , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy it is with his <unk> self .
so the correlation is low .
we know something about what the happiness of the <unk> .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is mainly like being content with people that we like , to spend time with people we like .
there are other pleasure , but this is dominant .
so , if you want to maximize the two of these two types of yourself , you want to do very different things at the end .
so the conclusion from what i said is that we really do n't think of happiness as a substitute for well-being .
it 's a completely other idea .
now , very short , another reason that we can not think about happiness is that we 're not looking at the same things when we think about life , and if we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in california , you 're not going to get the correct answer .
now , if you ask this question , you think that people in california need to be happier when you are , we say , `` say , in ohio .
and what 's happening is that when you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and this difference is , we say , in climate .
now , it turns out that climate is not very important for the <unk> self , and it 's not even very important for the lack self that decides how happy people are .
now , because the great self is responsible , you can see , in the end -- some people could go to california .
and it 's kind of interesting to track what happens to people who are moving to california .
now , her <unk> self will not be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you will think that you are happier , because if you think about it , you 're going to think about how awful the weather in ohio , and you 're going to feel that you met the right decision .
it 's very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i 'm hoping i can tell you a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question .
thank you very much .
now , when we looked at a couple of weeks ago , i 've been looking at a couple of weeks ago , that there was a pretty interesting result , which came from this <unk> survey .
is this what you can talk about , because you have a few minutes left ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most interesting result that we found in the <unk> survey is a number that we have absolutely not expected .
and we found that in terms of the <unk> self .
and if we were looking at how emotions get over income .
and it turns out that over a year of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it 's a great representative sample , under a income of 600,000 dollars in a year .
60,000 .
dk : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy unhappy , and they will become increasingly unhappy , ever poorer .
it 's a absolutely flat line .
i mean , i rarely saw so flat lines .
what happens is that you do n't think money does n't have a <unk> , but that lack of money will raise money , and we can measure this misery .
in the sense of the other self , the <unk> self , you get another story .
the more money you make the family you have .
that 's not for emotions .
but danny , all the american endeavor is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
when people would take seriously , i mean , it seems to be all about the head , everything we believe , for example , for example , and so on .
is there a chance of that politicians , that the country is generally going to take a confrontation like that seriously , and we would do based on it ?
dk : you know , i think it 's recognition for the role of <unk> in politics .
the recognition is going to be slowly in the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom , it 's happening and in other countries .
the people are to think that you should be lucky thinking when you think about politics .
it will take a while , and people are going to discuss whether they want to look at <unk> , or if you want to explore , so we need to take this discussion pretty soon .
so how you 're lucky can get a very different way of thinking about how you think and think that you think of the <unk> self or whether you think about the <unk> self .
this will affect politics , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states , you 're asking to measure the <unk> of the population .
that will be , i think , i think , in the next few decades , i think , is two decades part of the national statistic .
well , it seems to me , i think it 's going to be this topic , at least the most interesting political debate will be the political debate over the next couple of years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i 'm jane mcgonigal . i do design video games .
i think now , i 'm going to think about 10 years , and my goal for the next decade , it 's just to make it just easy to save the world in reality .
i have a plan for this . i want to persuade more people , including them to spend more time with the play and <unk> games .
now we spend three billion hours per week .
some of you may think , `` that 's a lot of time for games . ''
maybe a lot of time when you think about how many problems we need to solve in the real world .
but actually , in fact , my research on the institute is just the opposite is the opposite .
three billion hours per week are not close enough to solve the most serious problems of the world .
in fact , i 'm convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase this time dramatically .
i 've got the idea that that takes us to be a time for 21 billion hours of <unk> per week .
now , this may be something <unk> first , so i 'm going to do it , so if we can do problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity , i think we need to try online ,
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this picture is pretty much exactly why i believe that games are so important for survival of the human species in the future .
this is a tudor photograph of the photographer <unk> .
he wanted to capture the emotions . so he wanted to look at the way , and so he was building a camera .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
if you 're not a player , maybe you can see some of the <unk> in this picture .
you probably see this sense of urgency , a little bit fear , but also a very good focus , which is a way to solve a really difficult problem .
if you 're playing , you see some <unk> here , which is the top <unk> eyes , and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the brow show surprise .
this is a player that 's on the edge of a <unk> <unk> .
oh , you know that . all right . so we have some players here .
a <unk> victory is a result , which is so most positive is that they did n't know that they did n't know before .
it was almost beyond imagination .
and if you reach it , you 're shocked that you actually are capable of that , that 's a <unk> victory .
this is a very short victory .
and this is what we have to look at million faces around the world , if we need to take the barriers of the next century , the face of which , the face of all odds are standing on the edge of a <unk> .
well , sadly , we see this face in the real life when we face a lot of problems .
i call it as `` in life , i 'm bad . and it 's actually my face , see ? yes ? ok .
this is me , like i am , i 'm bad .
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i was in my ph.d. , i found why we 're more better than in the real life .
this is a problem that have many players .
we think we 're not as good as in play .
and i do n't just mean , i mean , not just less successful , although that is yours .
and we 're moving into <unk> more , and i mean good in the context of the motivation , something <unk> is inspired to collaboration .
if we are in a <unk> , i think many of us are moving into our best version , a lot of the best version , and immediately is going to try to solve the problem , as long as you try to try and try to try to try to try to
and in reality , if we are failing , we feel we feel differently .
we feel overwhelmed . we defeated ourselves . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or <unk> .
these feelings never have , when we play games , in play , they 're just not .
and that 's what i wanted to explore as a <unk> .
why is it impossible to think , if you could n't do anything ?
how can we transmit these feelings in the reality ?
so i looked like , like , like , like world of warcraft , which offers the ideal environment for a collaborative problem .
and i found some things , the epic <unk> in <unk> can do that .
so , first , when you come in one of these <unk> , all of the world of warcraft , there 's a lot of different characters who are ready to be a <unk> mission .
but not just any mission , but a mission to fit perfectly to your current level , right ?
so you create that .
you never get a task that you ca n't solve .
but always on the edge of their ability , so you have to be hard . but there 's no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you 're not sitting around , and you 're <unk> . it 's always to do something important .
and there are tons of employees .
where you go to hundreds of hundreds of thousands of people working with them together to close their epic mission .
we do n't think that , in the true life , we do n't like that , that sense of a <unk> <unk> .
and also , there 's the epic story , this inspiring story , why we are and what we have to do .
so let 's get this whole positive feedback .
they 've certainly been hearing by `` level high '' and `` plus-one strength '' or `` plus-one intelligence . ''
this constant feedback is not in the true life .
if i leave this stage , i 'm not going to be plus-one talking and plus-one crazy idea , <unk> crazy idea .
i do n't get the true life of this feedback .
so , the problem of <unk> , like the world of warcraft is that it 's so gratifying that it 's as gratifying , will be on the edge of a <unk> <unk> that we 'd rather spend our entire time in these <unk> .
they 're just better than reality .
until today , all the world of <unk> have spent <unk> million years to solve the virtual problems of <unk> .
that 's not necessarily bad .
it may sound bad .
but to see it in the context , over <unk> million years ago , we began to go forward to the first <unk> .
so the first step is <unk> .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we spend at play right now , it 's just a way to make the time in terms of human flourishing .
but also , because it turns out that we can actually use these whole time in the play , actually change what we are able to be able to .
we 're going to start with collaborative collaborative , moving creatures .
that 's the truth . i think .
looking at the interesting statistics that was published in recent scientists who was published in recent university , the average young human face in a country in a country with a number of mobile phones with <unk> to the 21st .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , two reasons .
first of all , in the united states , <unk> hours of <unk> that you spend in school , and that 's the five school high school class -- if you never been missing .
so , we have a complete <unk> system , on the young people , the young people , what it means to be a good player , how everything else you learn in school .
and maybe some of you have some new book of malcolm convergence , `` <unk> . ''
so you know his theory of the success , the theory of about 10,000 hours .
it 's based on the great research of <unk> that , if we spend 10,000 hours with the advent of a couple of matter to the 21st , we 're going to confront it .
we 're going to be so good in doing what the most important people in the world .
so what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is , `` what are you going to do ? ''
because if we could figure it out , we would have never been able to have a <unk> of human potential .
so many people we have in the world right now , at least one hour a day with <unk> .
these are our <unk> , 500 million people , which are exceptional in `` something . ''
and in the next decade , we have another billion players , which is always exceptional .
if you have n't heard it .
the <unk> developed <unk> that will save and work on <unk> , instead of <unk> that players are going to play around the world , especially in india , china , brazil online .
you expect a additional billion players in the next decade .
so that we have 1.5 billion players .
so i started thinking about what this games is to rise to us .
here 's the four things that i found . the first thing that i found .
ok , imagine this like extreme <unk> .
<unk> is the desire immediately to do something like this , together with believe that we have a <unk> hope of success .
so , players always believe that a <unk> victory is possible , and that it 's still worth trying to try and now .
the players are not sitting around .
so players are masters in the <unk> of social grids .
there 's a lot of more interesting research , which we show people that we have more like , after we have been playing with them , even if they defeated ourselves .
the reason for this is that it requires a lot of trust , with somebody playing a game .
we trust that somebody 's going to take time with us that the rules are going to be <unk> that we have the same goal to be the same target and to the <unk> .
so , you can see that you can grow the grid of ties , trust and trust .
as a result of these , we build more powerful social relationships .
<unk> productivity . fantastic .
you know , there 's a reason why the <unk> of <unk> is plays a week , as a <unk> .
the reason is , if we are playing , we 're actually happier , work to work hard when we relax or nothing .
we know that we 're going to work as human beings , if we do hard , great work .
and players are always ready to work hard when you get the right task .
and ultimately , epic meaning .
players love to be part of the awe of the awe of the <unk> of the world 's <unk> .
here 's a <unk> that is coming into the right light . you know all wikipedia , the largest <unk> of the world .
the second largest <unk> in the world , with nearly 80,000 <unk> , is the world of warcraft .
five million people are using every month .
they have <unk> more information about world of warcraft on the internet than about any other issue in any other <unk> of the world .
they create an epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers who lead to a single outcome . players are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
it 's people who believe that they can be able to change the world .
and the only problem is that you think you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real way .
this is the problem that i try to solve .
now edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is great . he 's studying why people are doing so much time , energy and money in <unk> .
and he says , `` we 're going to be less than a <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> . ''
and that 's the economist . so he 's logical .
and he says ...
not like i ... i 'm going to play , i 'm a little bit more comfortable .
so he 's saying , that makes sense , because players can achieve more than the real life .
you can make it in play social interactions , and you can make it in the real life . you get more feedback and reward in play than in the real life .
so , he says , `` well , it 's completely completely logical that players will spend more time in the virtual world than in the real way .
voice , that 's logical .
but it 's definitely not a <unk> .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from one event , the 2,500 years ago .
there are these <unk> cubes , from <unk> . you know ?
this fantastic <unk> were <unk> .
and that was the first thing , the first of people had developed <unk> .
and if you 're familiar with the work of the old greek <unk> , you may be familiar with this story , you may know this story , the story about how to be invented .
it 's been <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in the kingdom , in the kingdom are invented in a famine .
and clearly , there was such a great famine that the king of <unk> were going to a crazy idea .
people were breathing . people fighting .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented it , according to the <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> for a day . the day you would eat . the next day you would play .
and you would be able to try so much into the <unk> , because games are so fascinating and with <unk> , <unk> productivity that you would forget that there was nothing .
and then the next day you would play , and the next day you would eat .
and they were pushing it out , they were pushing these famine for 18 years by using a day and the next day .
i think , i think we 're going to try today .
we 're going to try and get play one of the suffering the real world .
we 're going to try and make games to do anything that does n't work in the real world , particularly that is not gratifying in the real life , and we get what we need .
but it does n't have to be the end .
that 's the exciting thing .
it was n't very much for 18 years after 18 years of famine , so the king decided the king , a last <unk> <unk> .
they shared the kingdom in two .
they were playing a <unk> , and the winner were brought to a <unk> adventure .
they were <unk> , and they were looking looking for a new home , and they were just looking back to a new home , and they were going to go back to the way it was eating food , and looking at the rest of a area where they could thrive .
sounds crazy , right ?
but latest <unk> shows that the <unk> , which later <unk> rich , the same dna as the old <unk> .
so scientists came up recently that <unk> was actually true .
and geologists found the evidence of a global communications that took for almost 20 years , what happened the famine .
so this crazy story could be voices .
and maybe they actually rescued their people by playing , and they have been saved 18 years in games , and then they had these <unk> , and so much about the way that they learned that they have saved the whole civilization .
so we can also do that .
we 've been play since 1994 .
this was the first <unk> in real world of <unk> . that was 16 years ago .
they were <unk> for 18 years , we 've been playing for 16 years .
i say , we 're ready for our own <unk> game .
so , they sent half of their civilization to the search for a new world , so i suppose i 'm going to take my 21st of the 21st of the world 's age of <unk> per week .
we should say that half of us spend a hour every day with play , until we solved the problems of the real world .
i know you 're going to say , `` how do we solve problems of the real world in play ? '' and this question i have to work in my job for the last few years in the future .
we have this banner in our office in palo alto , which ought to understand how to understand the future .
we do n't want to try to say the future before .
what we want to create is the future .
we want to imagine the best outcome , and then human beings will be able to make sure about this idea of reality .
we imagine epic <unk> , and we give people the opportunities to reach them .
i 'm going to show you all three games that i 've designed to try to make people get <unk> <unk> in their own future .
this is `` world without oil . ''
the game is from 2007 .
it 's a jelly that you have to overcome a <unk> .
the <unk> is invented , but we have enough <unk> to do it , so it 's going to be realistic for you , and it 's actually going to actually live in your life without oil without oil . so , if you look at play , you can tell you how much oil will be <unk> , how much oil will be <unk> , and you have to be true , and we have to make your real lives , and we 're going to be true ,
we have tested this game with <unk> players in 2007 . and we 've got it since the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience .
nobody wants to change his life because it 's good for the environment or because we should .
but if you 're in a <unk> adventure and say , `` we 're going to be oil . ''
this is a fascinating adventure to that you go .
find out how you would survive . most of our players have <unk> behavior in the game .
so we have a bigger problem , which is a bigger , more than <unk> .
we 've developed the game `` <unk> '' at the institute .
and what is computation is a calculation of a <unk> that human beings have only left on the planet .
this supercomputers is called global <unk> , of course .
the call to the player , to pick up , we almost designed for a `` <unk> . ''
you know jerry <unk> , where it 's called the <unk> , and they have the astronauts , the scientists , the <unk> , and just can you save the world .
but in our game , instead of only five people , we say , everybody is in the <unk> , and it 's our job , the future of energy , food , health , health and the future of social justice .
the 8,000 player was playing the game for eight weeks .
and they found 500 to smart solutions that you can read if they 're `` <unk> . ''
and the last game we put on march 's march , it 's a game in collaboration with the world bank .
and if you finish the game , you get the distinction of the world bank , the distinction is `` social <unk> . ''
we work with universities in completely sub-saharan africa and invite them to learn social practice .
we have a comic <unk> , we have a level of knowledge to <unk> , <unk> , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i want to invite you to share this game with a game with young people around the world , especially in <unk> , which is to imagine their own social enterprise to save the world .
so i 'm going to go .
i want to ask you something .
what , do you think next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we have n't saved the real world .
well , i hope that you agree with me agree that players are human resources that we can use to work in the real life , and that games have a big importance for change .
we have these superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability to knit , strong social grids , <unk> and demand for meaning .
i really hope we 're going to play all the great games together to survive another century .
and i hope you 're going to design play with me , and play play .
if i 'm going to go into next decade , i 'm sure that we can create every <unk> future , and that we can play all sorts of games .
so i say , let 's play the <unk> games .
thank you .
i 'd like to tell you something about a couple months ago for a couple of months ago .
i 've got to write my <unk> <unk> , but i was done with the process of <unk> , and i realized that i 've never been in my life , which is what the word `` disabled ''
i 'm going to read you the <unk> .
`` in <unk> , '' <unk> : `` <unk> , '' <unk> , useless , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : healthy , strong , unstable . ''
i 'd read this list of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend , and i had to laugh , it was just so ridiculous , but i was just <unk> , and i could n't get to read , and i did n't have to read and go to reading and i 'm going to read
and of course , it was a <unk> , old <unk> . i just thought that patients have to be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy of the early late late late in the early late , when i was just starting with elementary school , and i started to build my own self outside of my family building and form , to other children and the rest world around me .
and thank god , i did n't use a <unk> .
i would take this for a post seriously , i would like somebody like somebody like me as a person whose lives can be positive in a legitimate way . but i 'm going to share for the opportunities and adventure that i 've experienced .
so i 'd like to get out of the <unk> of 2009 , and expect me to find a <unk> here .
here 's the <unk> version of this <unk> .
<unk> is not much better .
and in particular , me <unk> the last two words under `` close '' `` well '' and `` healthy . ''
but it 's not just about words .
it 's about what we think about the people that we describe with these words .
it 's about the values that are in these words , and how we build these values .
our language is influenced our thinking and how we see the world and people around us .
many <unk> societies , including the greek societies , including the greek , actually , really believed that the <unk> of a <unk> has a great force , because what you can do .
so , what do we need to be <unk> -- a <unk> human or powerful people ?
now , in fact , to call a human <unk> as a child , you might be able to think of it , they would n't be <unk> and <unk> .
would n't it be beautiful , open doors ?
one person that open doors to me open doors was my pediatrician at the <unk> , <unk> institute in <unk> .
he 's called dr. <unk> , a <unk> whose name , as you can think , most americans can not say , so he 's always called dr. p. .
and dr. p. <unk> was going to go very colorful , and it was just like work with kids .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- except to my <unk> .
i had to think of that , i had to be able to repeat , with these <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- in different colors -- you know , to break my <unk> , and i hated them . i hated them .
and imagine , i even used to treat a <unk> child with dr. p. collaboration , and tried to stop these exercises , <unk> without success .
and one day , he was looking at one of my exercises -- these practice were just <unk> and <unk> -- and he said , `` wow , <unk> , you are a strong , <unk> and young girl , you will catch one of these <unk> .
and if you can make it , i give you a hundred dollars . ''
this was just a easier trick by dr. p. , so i do the exercises that i do n't want to do with the prospect , that the richest five stick in the hospital , but he has actually brought me to see my everyday <unk> with new eyes , it 's been
and i 'm thinking about how much his vision from me as strong , and <unk> young girls shaped my self , and i could think of myself as one of nature of nature , powerful and <unk> .
this is just one example of many , as adults in <unk> can prompt the imagination of a child .
but as they already quoted examples of the <unk> , we do n't think of our language , our language is not to imagine something that we all want to think , is every single one of us to see themselves as powerful people .
our language , our language <unk> the social changes behind , which are caused in many cases of a technological change .
and of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , to say , my legs , the <unk> of <unk> , of <unk> , of titan and artificial <unk> of the world that allow people to be able to do it , of the cultural platforms , to start to talk about social platforms , people will be engaged in a way of creating a own identity ,
so , maybe this is a given of this technological change , because the way that there are still a other truth , which is that every human human society can be a whole <unk> and very <unk> and that human ability to adapt , to adapt our biggest plus one of the biggest plus .
so , the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people still ask me to tell me how i 'm talking about flexibility , and i 'm going to say something , this sentence has never been <unk> , and i 've always been able to answer the questions of people , and i think i 'm going to understand why .
and this set of understanding of being comfortable with the idea of the idea of the idea that success or happiness depends on to be a challenge , not supposed to be <unk> with the experience of the experience , as if my life would be so successful , because i could perceive the potential fall of a prosthetic
but the truth is that we 're changing . of course , we 're shaped by the challenge , no physical , emotionally , or even both .
and i say that 's good .
odds are no obstacle that we need to be <unk> to get to our lives better .
odds are just our lives .
and i tend to be deeper than my shadow .
sometimes i realize that he 's very mind , sometimes he 's not looking at it , but he 's always with me .
and i do n't want to have the impact , or the <unk> of a human beings .
there 's a tremendous gap in the life and challenges , and these are just <unk> real , and every person 's going to be different , but the question is not , but we 're not going to get
so we 're not just responsible to preserve the people who we love to preserve <unk> , but they also prepare to get good with it .
and we do n't want to do our children , if we 're giving you the feeling that they ca n't adapt .
you 've got to separate two things , and you have to be able to be a medical fact that you have to be a medical fact , a amputee , and to the other , you know , for the social opinion , is whether i 'm an <unk> .
and to be honest , the only real and persistent disability , which i had to put apart with , is that the world 's all like , they can describe me with this issue .
in our desire to protect the people who get us on the heart , and to tell you the cool , hard truth about their medical prediction , or even a prediction of life that you expect , we need to take the basis that somebody 's actually
maybe this is the sort of concept that is only the point of what 's broken , and how we fix that , for every single disability , as a larger disability .
if we do n't treat a human rights , and it does n't look all its forces and possibilities , and acknowledge , we 're going to make in addition to the natural struggle you may have to lead , another disease .
we <unk> a person who has a value for our society .
so we have to look beyond the <unk> and focus on all the area of human environment .
but most important , it 's between the perception of our mismatch and our great <unk> .
we should n't be able to be <unk> or denial , we should n't try to avoid it , and we should be under the carpet , but it 's about recognizing the odds
i 'm going to be more likely to think that we do n't necessarily have to confront it , but that we 're open to be open to you , for example , to give them a little bit to use them at <unk> , and maybe even dance to dance .
and maybe we 're going to be more important than something natural , connecting and useful and can make us feel so <unk> .
in this year , we celebrate the 200 .
i 'd be like it , not the most powerful of the survive , and not the <unk> of his way , but the way that to adjust changes in the best .
from conflicts of creativity .
not just from darwin 's work , we know that the ability of human beings to survive and <unk> , from the battle of human mind , is to transform conflict .
so , again , change and adaptation are the great ability of people .
and maybe , you know , we 're going to know what wood is , when we really get solved .
perhaps that 's the sense of meaning , a perception of <unk> , a feeling of our own force .
we can do something like that .
we can make sense of a new meaning that comes out of it .
maybe we can think of perception as change .
odds are a change that we do n't have to be calibrated .
i think the biggest damage that we have to think about ourselves to believe is that we should be normal .
so frankly , who is normal ?
there 's no normal .
now , there 's the usual , the typical one , but not the normal , and would you really want to be familiar with these poor , gray person want to learn if they really would have been ?
i think , rather .
if we would be great , if we think of this paradigm of normal against a different amount of possibilities , or the strength to formulate a little bit more dangerous , to exchange . so we can release the forces of very many children , and invite you to bring their whole special and valuable skill in society .
<unk> have found that we have found human beings from the members of our society to be a <unk> , useful and to do a contribution .
there are clues about the neanderthals of 60,000 years ago , and people would have been supported by heavy intense injury , and that 's because the wisdom of these people were valuable to society .
they did n't think of these people as broken and futile ; they were treated as a special and useful .
a couple of years ago , i went to the city that i grew up in a <unk> in this red zone in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was there a <unk> tomatoes .
it was summer , and i had <unk> .
and i hear a guy like a guy saying , `` well , if this is not <unk> . ''
and i 'm looking at this older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , `` sorry , sir , know what ? i do n't remember . ''
and he said , `` well , you wo n't remember .
when i first saw her , i got her out of her belly . ''
oh , yeah .
and of course , it 's made it .
this was dr. <unk> , a man that i knew just from narratives of my mother about this day , because i was , of course , a typical , of my birthday two weeks .
the physician for <unk> diagnostics of my mother was in holiday , and so my parents knew the man that brought me to the world , at all .
and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet got to them , and i just had a couple toes on this and a few toes , he was in the other foot , he was the <unk> , that strangers had to say ,
he said to me , `` i had to tell your parents that you would never walk , and never like the <unk> like other children or that you could have been able to lead a <unk> life , and you just have been lying . ''
really , really extraordinary , i had gathered all of my childhood to my whole childhood , if i was won at a <unk> class in the second class , if i was on the <unk> , i 'd had to confront my scholarship , or one of my favorite experiments , and he used these clips to teach his students from <unk> medical school ,
and he called this part of his <unk> that x factor , the potential of human endeavor .
you can simply do n't think about how critical that factor for the quality of quality of life of life .
and dr. <unk> told me , he said , `` i learned that children , if you do n't get other people else , and even if you get a little bit of support when you do n't get yourself , children can achieve very much . ''
you see , dr. <unk> has changed his think .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone would address that , are two different things .
and i 've got my thinking in the time of time , if you had me , if you had me , if you 'd asked me , if i had my prostheses out of meat and bones , i would n't have a second .
and i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , it was very normal .
if you ask me this today , i 'm not sure .
and that 's happening , because i have seen something with my legs , and not despite these experiences .
and maybe this change could happen , because i 've seen so many people who were open doors to be able to step up , rather than looking at people who want me to pick up an idea .
you see , it really needs a human person who can be able to show you how they can be able to solve their forces , and they 're through .
if you enable somebody to activate its own , the human mind -- the human mind is so <unk> -- if you can do that , and open a critical moment , you 're a very good teacher .
they send them to open up the doors .
the real importance of the word `` <unk> '' is in the word `` <unk> . ''
it means that it means that in one is , potential for potential .
again , what potential is we want to be ?
in the '60s , in britain , in britain , was transformed in <unk> .
they call this `` <unk> <unk> '' in the united states , we call that as `` <unk> . ''
students are <unk> after notes .
and the a students are going to get <unk> harder to <unk> , the better teacher .
and they have been doing a lot of <unk> period , and they have been very good , they said they were very good , they were very smart , and after these three months , they really wrote a lot of <unk> .
and of course , of course , to listen to a heart that the <unk> was said , they 're just enough .
and then it was the three months .
but only those who still were in school -- except from the students who had schools .
the key thing about this trial was that the teachers were not <unk> .
the teachers did n't know that something got changed .
you just told you that it 's the student , and that the students are enough with the grade , and they have been trained and treated them .
the only real problem is a <unk> mind , a mind that was broken , has no hope . he does n't find our natural , <unk> curiosity . and our innate ability to imagination .
but if we 're going to be able to support the human spirit , to hope to hope and other people around , curious , curious and <unk> , we 're going to make our forces really positive .
if a mind has these qualities , we can create a new reality and new <unk> .
i want to end with a poem , which was written by a <unk> poet called <unk> in the 14 , and my friend <unk> is told , and the poem is , `` every child knows , god knows , '' `` every child , god knows , not the god of the name , not the god of the name of the name of the name of the name of the god , and this god 's god , he 's always repeat
come , dance with me . thank you very much .
